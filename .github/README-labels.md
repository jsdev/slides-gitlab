## 👍 GOOD IDEA LABELS
Recommended for mature or growing projects.

- **accessibility**: For issues or features related to accessibility (can be combined with bug, enhancement, etc.).
- **performance**: For speed, resource usage, or optimization topics.
- **refactor**: For codebase improvements not affecting features.
- **chore**: For non-feature, non-bug work (maintenance, upgrades).
- **localization**: For translation or internationalization issues.

## 💡 USEFUL LABELS

- **priority: high/medium/low**: For triaging and prioritizing work.
- **blocked**: For issues that cannot proceed due to dependencies.
- **duplicate**: For issues already reported.

## How to Use Labels Effectively
1. **Apply multiple labels as needed.** Example: `bug`, `accessibility`, `priority: high`.
2. **Use labels for filtering and reporting.** Example: Find all `accessibility` bugs.
3. **Review and update labels regularly.** Remove outdated or irrelevant labels.
4. **Document label meanings in your main README or CONTRIBUTING guide.**

## Example Label Combinations
- `bug`, `accessibility`, `priority: high` (Critical accessibility bug)
- `enhancement`, `performance` (Feature request for speed improvement)
- `documentation`, `localization` (Translation needed for docs)
- `refactor`, `test coverage` (Refactor with new tests)
- `security`, `help wanted` (Security issue needing attention)
