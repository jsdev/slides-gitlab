## Summary

Add localization support to the app so it can be used by people who don't know English.

## Motivation

Enabling localization will make the app accessible to a global audience and improve inclusivity.

## Proposed Solution

Implement i18n using a library like `react-intl` or `next-intl`. Allow users to select their preferred language and provide translation files for UI text.

## Alternatives Considered

- Manual translation of UI text
- Relying on browser auto-translate

## Additional Context

Start with Spanish and expand to other languages as needed.
