## Summary

Add a live collaboration mode so multiple users can edit and view slides in real-time.

## Motivation

This feature would enable teams to work together on presentations, improving productivity and reducing friction when preparing group slide decks.

## Proposed Solution

Implement real-time syncing using WebSockets or a service like Firebase. Show avatars of active collaborators and highlight changes live.

## Alternatives Considered

- Manual refresh for updates
- Export/import for merging changes

## Additional Context

Similar to Google Slides or Figma's collaboration features.
