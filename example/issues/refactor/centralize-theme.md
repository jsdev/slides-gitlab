## Area to Refactor

Theme management and application-wide styling.

## Motivation

Theme logic is currently duplicated in several components, making updates error-prone and inconsistent.

## Proposed Approach

Centralize theme management in a context provider or global store. Refactor components to consume theme from context.

## Risks / Considerations

- Refactor may affect existing theme customizations
- Need to ensure backward compatibility

## Additional Context

This will make it easier to add new themes and maintain consistent styling.
