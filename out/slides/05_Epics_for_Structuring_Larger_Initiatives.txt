# **Unlocking Your Potential**

## **Most teams use about 20% of GitLab's capabilities.**

Today, we start unlocking the other 80%.

*(Graphic: A visual of an iceberg, with the small tip labeled "What most teams use" and the large submerged part labeled "What we'll unlock today.")*

# **GitLab is Three Tools in One**

## **The Integrated DevOps Platform**

# **A Seamless Flow**

## **From Idea to Production**

* Your user stories become issues.  
* Issues connect to code changes.  
* Code changes trigger deployments.

*(Graphic: A simple flow diagram: `Issue Icon` \-\> `Code Branch Icon` \-\> `Pipeline Icon` \-\> `Rocket Icon`)*

# **UI Navigation: Your Mission Control**

## **The Project Dashboard**

* Shows activity across all your projects.  
* Think of it as your personal news feed for all GitLab activity.  
* **Key Concept:** The left sidebar is context-sensitive; it changes based on whether you're in a Group or a Project.

*(Graphic: A screenshot of the GitLab project dashboard with the left sidebar highlighted.)*

# **Key Sidebar Exploration**

## **Your Toolkit for Planning & Execution**

A visual list of key sidebar items with brief descriptions.

* **Issues:** Your backlog, tasks, and user stories.  
* **Boards:** Your visual workflow (Kanban).  
* **Epics:** Your themes and initiatives (the big picture).  
* **Milestones:** Your sprints, releases, and time boxes.  
* **Roadmaps:** Strategic visualization over time.  
* **Merge Requests:** Where code review happens.  
* **Repository:** Your actual code files and Git history.

# **Groups vs. Projects**

## **Understanding the Hierarchy**

This hierarchy matters because permissions and features work differently at each level.

**Groups**

* Your team, department, or organization.  
* *Analogy: A Folder*

**Projects**

* Individual repositories or work streams.  
* *Analogy: Files inside the folder*

*(Graphic: An icon of a folder labeled "Group" containing three file icons labeled "Project.")*

# **Example Hierarchy**

## **How It Looks in Practice**

**Group: 'Marketing Team'**

* Project: 'Website'  
* Project: 'Campaign Management'  
* Project: 'Analytics Dashboard'

**Group: 'Engineering'**

* Project: 'Frontend App'  
* Project: 'Backend API'  
* Project: 'Mobile App'

# **Activity: Time to Explore**

## **Navigation Practice**

* It's your turn to explore the GitLab UI.  
* The goal is to get comfortable clicking around and seeing what's there.  
* Think of this as a scavenger hunt. Don't worry about understanding everything yet.
6:T13e0,# **Module 2: Mastering Issue Management & Integrated Time Tracking**

## **The Backbone of Your Scrum Workflow**

![GitLab Logo](https://about.gitlab.com/images/press/logo/png/gitlab-icon-rgb.png) + ![Veloz Logo](https://img1.wsimg.com/isteam/ip/55a4d049-b669-44b1-befb-5cbb852ac163/Veloz-Logo.svg/:/rs=w:59,h:59,cg:true,m/cr=w:59,h:59/qt=q:100/ll)


# **Today's Goals**

* **Create rich, structured issues** that actually help your team
* **Track time** without additional tools or spreadsheets
* **Build relationships** between issues to show dependencies
* Use  
   **advanced features** that most teams don't even know exist

# **Beyond a Title & Description**

## **Moving from a simple task to a shared understanding.**

A great issue is more than just a title. It's a "contract" that contains everything needed to get the work done. We can achieve this with structured markdown.

*(Graphic: A simple text title on the left, transforming into a structured document icon on the right.)*

# **Anatomy of a Rich Issue**

Example: "Implement User Authentication" 6

* **User Story:** As a \[user\], I want \[action\], so that \[benefit\].
* **Business Value:** Why are we building this?
* **Acceptance Criteria:** A checklist of what "done" looks like.
* **Technical Notes:** Guidance for the developer.
* **Definition of Done:** Team-wide quality checklist.

*(Graphic: A screenshot or well-formatted text block showing the different sections of the example issue.)*

# **Adding Rich Metadata**

## **Context at a Glance**

Use the sidebar to add crucial context to every issue.

* **(Icon) Assignees:** Assign multiple people for pair programming or collaboration.
* **(Icon) Milestone:** Connect the issue to a sprint or release.
* **(Icon) Due Date:** Set a clear deadline.
* **(Icon) Labels:** Categorize the work (e.g., bug, feature, backend).
* **(Icon) Weight:** Estimate effort using story points.

# **Task Lists: Your Interactive Checklist**

## **Two pieces of magic in one feature.**

1. **Live Progress Tracking:** GitLab automatically tracks the completion percentage as you check items off.
2. **Create Linked Issues:** Convert any task list item into its own issue with a single click, automatically linking it back to the original story.

*(Graphic: A before/after animation showing a task being checked off and the progress bar updating, then another task turning into a linked issue.)*

# **Issue Relationships: Visualizing Dependencies**

See what's blocking progress instantly.

| Relationship | Purpose |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Related to** | A general connection; these issues are similar but not dependent. |
| **Blocks** | This issue must be finished before the other one can start. |
| **Blocked by** | This issue cannot start until the other one is finished. |

*(Graphic: A simple diagram showing three issue icons connected by these three relationship types.)*

# **Issue Templates: Work Smarter**

Ensure consistency and save time.

* Create reusable templates for common issue types like bug reports or user stories.
* When anyone creates a new issue, they can select a template to pre-fill the description with the required structure.

*(Graphic: A screenshot showing the "Choose a template" dropdown in the new issue view.)*

# **Integrated Time Tracking**

## **Ditch the Spreadsheets**

* GitLab's time tracking is built right into issues.
* It connects directly to your workflow and generates reports automatically.
* No more separate systems or manual data entry.

# **Time Tracking with Quick Actions**

Use slash commands in comments to log time.

To Estimate Time:

/estimate 2d 4h 30m

To Log Time Spent:

/spend 2h Working on login validation

To Correct Time:

/spend \-30m

*(Graphic: A screenshot of a comment box in GitLab with an example slash command being typed.)*

# **Where Does the Data Go? Time Reports**

## **Visualize your team's effort.**

* **Issue List View:** See Time Estimate vs. Time Spent for every issue.
* **Milestone Reports:** Get a roll-up of all time tracked for an entire sprint.
* **User Reports:** Understand team capacity and velocity.

*(Graphic: A collage of small screenshots showing these different reporting views.)*

# **Time Tracking Best Practices**

Use data for learning, not for punishment. 36

| DO ✅ | DON'T ❌ |
| :---- | :---- |
| Estimate during sprint planning. 37 | Get obsessed with perfect accuracy. |
| Log time daily. 39 | Use it for performance reviews without context. |
| Be consistent with granularity. 41 | Force people to account for every minute. |
| Focus on patterns, not individuals. 43 | Ignore the data; if you don't use it, don't collect it. |

# **Module Recap**

## **Key Concepts Mastered**

* ✅  **Rich Issue Creation:** Using markdown, templates, and structured content.  
* ✅  **Advanced Features:** Understanding relationships, assignees, due dates, and weights.
* ✅  **Integrated Time Tracking:** Estimation, logging, and reporting without external tools.
* ✅  **Team Conventions:** The importance of consistency for making features work.

# **Questions?**
7:T14ec,# **Module 3: Strategic Labeling & Powerful Filtering**

## **From Sticky Notes to a Structured Database**

![GitLab Logo](https://about.gitlab.com/images/press/logo/png/gitlab-icon-rgb.png) + ![Veloz Logo](https://img1.wsimg.com/isteam/ip/55a4d049-b669-44b1-befb-5cbb852ac163/Veloz-Logo.svg/:/rs=w:59,h:59,cg:true,m/cr=w:59,h:59/qt=q:100/ll)


# **Today's Goals**

* **Design label systems** that actually help instead of confuse.  
* **Find any work in seconds** using advanced filtering.  
* **Create saved searches** that replace your daily manual hunting.  
* **Set up label automation** that works while you sleep.

# **The Common Challenge: Label Chaos**

*(Graphic: A word cloud or a messy pile of digital "sticky notes" with conflicting and inconsistent labels.)*

**Labels often become a source of confusion:**

* Inconsistent naming (e.g.,  
   `bug`, `Bug`).  
* Duplicates (e.g.,  
   `high priority`, `high-priority`, `urgent`).  
* Conflicting Information (e.g., an issue labeled both  
   `high priority` and `low priority`).

# **The Solution: Scoped Labels**

## **Bringing Structure with `scope::value`**

Scoped labels solve this with a simple concept: categories with values. Instead of random tags, you have structured data.

* `Priority::High`  
* `Team::Frontend`  
* `Type::Bug`  
* `Workflow::Ready`

*(Graphic: A simple animation showing messy labels being sorted into clean, colored, scoped labels.)*

# **How Scoped Labels Work**

## **One Value Per Scope**

The magic of scoped labels is that GitLab ensures

**only ONE label per scope can be applied** to an issue.

An issue **CANNOT** have both:

* `Priority::High`  
* `Priority::Low`

This enforces consistency and turns your labels into a reliable database.

# **Building a Label System**

## **A Live Demo Preview**

We will create a complete system with four key scopes, using color for instant visual scanning.

| Scope | Example Values (with colors) |  |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Workflow** |  | `workflow::backlog` (gray), `workflow::in-progress` (orange), `workflow::done` (green) |
| **Priority** |  | `priority::critical` (red), `priority::medium` (yellow), `priority::low` (light green) |
| **Team** |  | `team::frontend` (pink), `team::backend` (indigo), `team::qa` (purple) |
| **Type** |  | `type::bug` (red), `type::feature` (blue), `type::enhancement` (orange) |

Export to Sheets

# **Group vs. Project Labels**

## **Where you create labels matters.**

* **Group Labels:** Available to all projects in the group.  
   **Best for core, consistent labels** like Workflow, Priority, and Team.  
* **Project Labels:** Only available in the specific project.  
   **Best for project-specific needs** like Components or Releases.

*(Graphic: A diagram showing a large "Group" folder containing smaller "Project" files, with common labels defined at the Group level and specific labels at the Project level.)*

# **Unleash the Power of Search**

## **From Scrolling to Asking Questions**

With a good label system, you can stop scrolling and start asking GitLab complex questions like:

* "Show me all high priority bugs assigned to the frontend team."  
* "What's blocking our current sprint?"  
* "Find everything due this week that's not yet started."

# **Advanced Search Syntax**

## **Your "Cheat Sheet"**

Combine keywords to find exactly what you need.

| Keyword | Example |  |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| `label:` |  | `label:priority::high` |
| `assignee:` |  | `assignee:@me` |
| `milestone:` |  | `milestone:"Current Sprint"` |
| `not` |  | `not label:workflow::done` |
| `due_date:` |  | `due_date:overdue` |

Export to Sheets

# **Example: A Real-World Search**

## **"My Sprint Focus"**

This query finds all high-priority work assigned to me in the current sprint that is not yet done.

`label:priority::high assignee:@me milestone:"Current Sprint" not label:workflow::done`

*(Graphic: Break down the search query into visual blocks, explaining what each part does.)*

# **Save Time with Automation**

## **Saved Searches & Subscriptions**

**Saved Searches**

* Save complex queries so you never have to retype them.  
* Build a personal dashboard of one-click reports like 'My Current Work' or 'Overdue Items'.

**Label Subscriptions**

* Get notified automatically when a specific label is added to an issue.  
* Perfect for QA teams subscribing to  
   `workflow::ready-for-testing`.

# **Best Practices for Label Governance**

## **Keep Your System Clean and Useful**

| DO ✅ | DON'T ❌ |
| :---- | :---- |
| Use consistent naming conventions. | Create too many one-off labels. |
| Document your system in a wiki. | Use colors randomly. |
| Start simple and evolve. | Let anyone create labels without discussion. |
| Regularly clean up unused labels. | Duplicate features (e.g., a label for a milestone). |

Export to Sheets

# **Module Recap**

## **Key Concepts Mastered**

* **Scoped Labels:** You can create structured, hierarchical label systems that scale.  
* **Advanced Search Syntax:** You can find any work in seconds using complex queries.  
* **Saved Searches:** You've built a personal arsenal of searches that save time daily.  
* **Label Subscriptions:** You know how to create automatic awareness systems.

# **Today's Goals**

* **Create** sprint, release, and project milestones that drive your workflow.  
* **Use** GitLab's burndown charts to track progress in real-time.  
* **Build** milestone templates that save hours of sprint planning.  
* **Connect** milestones to your broader release planning strategy.

# **What is a Milestone?**

## **A Time-Based Container for Your Work**

* Milestones are more than just deadlines; they are flexible containers for different types of work cycles.  
* They transform your sprints from intuition-based efforts into data-driven workflows.

*(Graphic: An icon of a calendar or a clock with issues flowing into it.)*

# **The Three Types of Milestones**

From Daily Sprints to Strategic Projects

| Sprint Milestones | Release Milestones | Project Milestones |  |  |  |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
|  | **Duration:** 1-3 weeks |  | **Duration:** 4-8 weeks |  | **Duration:** 2-6 months |
|  | **Purpose:** Deliver working software incrementally |  | **Purpose:** Deliver cohesive features to users |  | **Purpose:** Achieve strategic business objectives |
|  | **Example Name:** 'Sprint 2024.01' |  | **Example Name:** 'Release v2.1.0' |  | **Example Name:** 'Mobile App Launch' |

Export to Sheets

# **The Milestone Hierarchy**

## **A clear chain from daily work to strategic goals.**

Project milestones contain release milestones, which contain sprint milestones.

*(Graphic: A nested diagram showing a large "Project Milestone" box containing two "Release Milestone" boxes, with each of those containing three smaller "Sprint Milestone" boxes.)*

# **Anatomy of a Sprint Milestone**

## **Your Sprint Charter**

A great milestone is more than just a title and a due date. It's a complete container with goals, capacity, and success criteria.

* **Sprint Goal:** What are we trying to achieve?  
* **Sprint Capacity:** How much work can we realistically do?  
* **Success Criteria:** How do we know we were successful?  
* **Sprint Schedule:** What are our key dates and meetings?  
* **Definition of Done:** A reminder of our quality standards.

# **Making Sprints Predictable**

## **Capacity Planning & Burndown Charts**

*(This is a transition slide to Part B of the module.)*

# **Capacity Planning: The Formula**

## **From Guesswork to a Data-Driven Estimate**

**Formula:** `Team Size x Sprint Duration x Availability = Total Capacity`

**Example:** 5 developers × 8 story points/sprint × 0.8 availability \= **32 story points** of capacity.

# **Introducing: The Burndown Chart**

## **Your Visual Progress Tracker**

This chart shows three critical pieces of information:

1. **Ideal Burndown (gray line):** The perfect path to completion.  
2. **Actual Burndown (colored line):** Your team's real progress.  
3. **Scope Changes (vertical jumps):** When work is added or removed.

*(Graphic: A sample burndown chart with the three lines clearly labeled.)*

# **Interpreting Burndown Patterns**

## **From Healthy to Crisis at a Glance**

| Healthy Patterns ✅ | Warning Signs ⚠️ | Crisis Indicators 🚨 |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Actual line tracks close to ideal. | Flat lines (no progress). | Burndown line goes UP. |
| Steady downward progress. | Actual line is consistently above ideal. | Massive gap between actual and ideal. |

Export to Sheets

# **Beyond Burndown: Other Health Metrics**

## **A Complete Picture of Sprint Health**

* **Completion Rate:** Percentage of committed stories completed.  
* **On-Time Delivery:** Stories completed by their due dates.  
* **Velocity Trending:** Story points completed per sprint over time.  
* **Cycle Time:** Average time from 'In Progress' to 'Done'.

# **Advanced Strategies**

## **Release Planning & Automation**

*(This is a transition slide to Part C of the module.)*

# **Release Planning with Milestones**

## **The Bigger Picture**

Use a `Release Milestone` to group your sprints and track progress towards a major feature delivery.

**Release Milestone Template:**

* **Release Goal:** What is the overall objective?  
* **Release Scope:** Which epics are included?  
* **Quality Gates:** What are the exit criteria?  
* **Release Schedule:** What are the key deployment dates?

# **Power-User Tips for Milestones**

## **Work Smarter, Not Harder**

* **Bulk Issue Management:** Use issue boards to drag-and-drop issues between milestones.  
* **Milestone Templates:** Save your detailed milestone descriptions as templates for reuse.  
* **Integration with Labels:** Create powerful filters and saved searches like `milestone:current AND label:blocked`.  
* **Group-Level Milestones:** Create milestones at the group level for organization-wide initiatives.

# **Module Recap**

## **Key Concepts Mastered**

* **Milestone Types:** You understand sprint, release, and project milestones and how they nest.  
* **Capacity Planning:** You can calculate realistic team capacity and track it in real-time.  
* **Burndown Tracking:** You can read burndown charts and identify sprint health patterns.  
* **Sprint Templates:** You have reusable templates that save hours of planning time.  
* **Integration Strategy:** You see how milestones connect to broader release planning.

9:T121b,# **Module 5: Epics for Structuring Larger Initiatives**

## **From Individual Tasks to Strategic Themes**

![GitLab Logo](https://about.gitlab.com/images/press/logo/png/gitlab-icon-rgb.png) + ![Veloz Logo](https://img1.wsimg.com/isteam/ip/55a4d049-b669-44b1-befb-5cbb852ac163/Veloz-Logo.svg/:/rs=w:59,h:59,cg:true,m/cr=w:59,h:59/qt=q:100/ll)


# **Today's Goals**

* **Create epics** that connect business strategy to daily work.  
* **Structure epic hierarchies** that make sense for your organization.  
* **Use epic boards** to visualize strategic progress.  
* **Connect epics to roadmaps** for stakeholder communication.  
* **Track epic progress** across multiple teams and milestones.

# **What is an Epic?**

## **The Chapters in Your Product Story**

If issues are the individual pages, epics are the chapters that group them together into a coherent story.

* Epics are strategic themes or initiatives.  
* They help you track progress on large features that span multiple sprints.  
* They are containers for related issues that together deliver a meaningful business outcome.

# **Epic vs. Issue**

## **A Quick Comparison**

A simple guideline: If it can be done in one sprint, it's likely an issue. If it takes multiple sprints to deliver a full experience, it's a great candidate for an epic.

| Issues | Epics |
| :---- | :---- |
| Specific, actionable work items | Strategic themes or initiatives |
| Completed in days or weeks | Completed over weeks or months |
| Technical or task-focused | Business outcome-focused |
| Assigned to individuals or small teams | Involve multiple people or teams |

Export to Sheets

# **The Epic Hierarchy**

## **Tracking Progress at Every Level**

GitLab supports nested epics, allowing you to connect high-level strategy directly to individual tasks.

*(Graphic: A top-down flow chart showing the hierarchy)*

* **Portfolio Epic** (e.g., 'Q1 2024 Digital Transformation')  
  * **Program Epic** (e.g., 'Customer Portal Redesign')  
    * **Feature Epic** (e.g., 'User Authentication System')  
      * **Issue** (e.g., 'Implement OAuth login')

# **Anatomy of an Epic**

## **A Charter for Your Initiative**

A well-structured epic acts as the single source of truth for a major initiative.

Key Sections:

* **Epic Overview:** What is this initiative and why does it matter?  
* **Business Objectives:** What is the primary goal and how will success be measured?  
* **Scope (In & Out):** What is explicitly included and excluded?  
* **Success Criteria:** A checklist of what "done" looks like for the entire epic.  
* **Dependencies:** What does this epic block, and what is it blocked by?  
* **Stakeholders:** Who is the sponsor, owner, and lead?

# **Epic Templates**

## **Drive Consistency Across Your Organization**

Just like with issues, you can create templates for your epics. This is crucial for ensuring every major initiative starts with the same strategic context and structure.

*(Graphic: A screenshot showing the "Choose a template" dropdown in the new epic view.)*

# **Visualizing Strategy: Epic Boards**

## **Kanban for Your Initiatives**

Epic boards are like issue boards but for visualizing strategic progress.

They help you:

* Track strategic initiatives at a glance.  
* Visualize epic progress across different states (e.g., Backlog, In Progress, Done).  
* Identify bottlenecks at the strategic level.

# **Visualizing Timelines: Roadmaps**

## **Communicating Your Plan Over Time**

Roadmaps turn your epics into strategic communication tools.

* They provide a high-level timeline view of your epics.  
* They help you communicate strategic direction to stakeholders.  
* They allow you to track progress against strategic goals.

*(This is a preview of a premium feature that will be covered in more detail in Module 7.)*

# **The Full Picture**

## **How It All Connects**

Each GitLab feature builds on the last to create a complete project management system.

* What's blocked and why?  
* What's ready for the next team member?  
* Who is overloaded and who has capacity?  
* What's taking too long in each stage?

*(Graphic: On the left, a simple, generic Kanban board with columns "To Do," "In Progress," "Done.")*

# **The Problem: Generic Boards Tell a Vague Story**

## **The Generic Board**

A large, simple graphic showing three columns:

* **To Do**  
* **In Progress**  
* **Done**

**Caption below:** This gives a high-level view but doesn't map to your team's actual process.

# **The Solution: Workflow-Specific Boards**

## **Mirror Your Team's Real Process**

A side-by-side comparison.

**Left Side (Generic):**

* To Do  
* In Progress  
* Done

**Right Side (Software Dev Workflow):**

* Backlog  
* Ready for Development  
* In Progress  
* Code Review  
* Testing  
* Ready for Deploy  
* Done

**Key Takeaway:** Your board should be a mirror of your real process, not a generic template.

# **Live Demo: Building Our Workflow Board**

## **Live Demo**

We will now build a "Development Workflow" board together.

* **Focus Areas:**  
  * Creating columns that match a real development process.  
  * Using labels and milestones to filter each list.  
  * Applying board-wide filters to create a focused view.

*(Graphic: A large GitLab logo or a screenshot icon.)*

# **A New Dimension: Swimlanes**

## **Visualizing Work from Multiple Angles**

* Think of swimlanes as horizontal slices across your workflow columns.  
* They allow you to group your work by another dimension.

*(Graphic: A simple diagram showing vertical columns for "Workflow" and horizontal rows cutting across them labeled "Swimlanes.")*

# **Common Swimlane Dimensions**

## **How Do You Want to Group Your Work?**

* **By Epic:** See how each epic progresses through your workflow.  
* **By Assignee:** Instantly see each team member's workload across all stages.  
* **By Priority:** Track how high, medium, and low priority work is flowing.  
* **By Team:** See how work moves between different functional teams (Frontend, Backend, QA).

*(Icons beside each bullet point representing the concept.)*

# **Example: Swimlanes by Epic**

## **Strategic and Tactical View in One**

**Key Insights Gained:**

* Which epics are moving smoothly through development.  
* Which epics are stalled in a specific stage like code review.  
* Which epics are ready for deployment.

*(Graphic: A screenshot or mock-up of a GitLab board with clear horizontal swimlanes labeled "Epic 1: User Authentication" and "Epic 2: Profile Redesign.")*

# **Optimizing Flow with WIP Limits**

## **Stop Starting, Start Finishing**

* Work-in-Progress (WIP) limits prevent your team from starting too much work at once.  
* The theory is simple:  
   **Limited WIP \= Faster Flow**

*(Graphic: An icon of a "Stop" sign or a "funnel" to represent limiting work.)*

# **Why Limit WIP?**

## **The Benefits of Focus**

* **Reduces Context Switching:** Every additional task reduces overall efficiency.  
* **Improves Quality:** Rushed work creates more bugs and rework.  
* **Exposes Bottlenecks:** Limits clearly show where your workflow is getting stuck.  
* **Prevents Burnout:** Overloaded teams are stressed and less effective.

# **Setting WIP Limits in GitLab**

## **A Conscious Decision**

* When you exceed a WIP limit, GitLab shows a warning but does not block the action.  
* This makes breaking the rule a conscious team decision, not an accident.

*(Graphic: A screenshot of a board with numbers (e.g., 3/4) on top of the "In Progress" and "Code Review" columns, with one column highlighted in orange to show the warning.)*

# **Specialized Boards: One Size Fits None**

## **Different Views for Different Roles**

* The same set of issues can be viewed through different boards, each tailored for a specific purpose or role.

*(Graphic: A central icon representing "All Issues" with arrows pointing to smaller board icons labeled "Developer View," "QA View," and "PM View.")*

# **Example: The Product Manager Board**

## **View for Strategic Tracking**

* **Columns:** Backlog, Sprint Ready, In Progress, Done  
* **Swimlanes:** Epic  
* **Filter:** `milestone: "Current Sprint"`  
* **Purpose:** To track sprint progress and the status of major epics.

*(Graphic: A mock-up of this specific board configuration.)*

# **Connecting the Dots**

## **From Tactical Execution to Strategic Vision**

A visual flow diagram showing the progression of concepts learned so far: `Issues` (The What) \-\> `Boards` (The How) \-\> `Epics` (The Initiative) \-\> **`Roadmaps` (The When)**

**Key Takeaway:** We know *what* we're working on. Now, let's communicate *when* it will be delivered.

# **What is a Roadmap?**

## **The "Big Picture" Timeline**

* A roadmap is a dynamic, high-level timeline view of your epics.  
* It answers key stakeholder questions about timing and delivery schedules.  
* It transforms your detailed plans into an easy-to-understand visual story.

*(Graphic: A simple, clean icon representing a timeline or a Gantt chart.)*

# **Answering Stakeholder Questions**

## **From "What's the Status?" to "Here's the Plan"**

A list of questions that roadmaps help answer:

* "What major initiatives are planned for Q3?"  
* "When can we expect the 'Customer Portal Redesign' to be complete?"  
* "Are there any overlaps in our upcoming feature releases?"

*(Graphic: A speech bubble icon next to each question.)*

# **The Anatomy of a GitLab Roadmap**

## **Key Features of the Roadmap View**

* **Timeline View:** Adjust between Weeks, Months, and Quarters.  
* **Epic Bars:** Each bar represents an epic, with its length determined by start and due dates.  
* **Progress Indicators:** See completion percentage directly on the epic bar.  
* **Milestone Overlays:** Visualize how releases align with your strategic initiatives.

*(Graphic: A screenshot of a GitLab roadmap with these four features highlighted with callout boxes.)*

# **Live Demo: Exploring the Roadmap**

## **Live Demo**

* We will now explore the **Epics \> Roadmap** view together.  
* **Focus Areas:**  
  * Adjusting the timeline view.  
  * Viewing epic details and progress.  
  * Dragging and dropping to adjust epic timelines.

*(Graphic: A large GitLab logo or a screenshot icon.)*

# **Activity: Build a Mini Roadmap**

## **Activity: Build Your Mini Roadmap**

* **Your Task:**  
  1. Navigate to the **Epics \> Roadmap** view.  
  2. Find at least three epics and ensure they have start and due dates.  
  3. Practice adjusting the timeline by dragging the epic bars.  
  4. Switch the view between 'Months' and 'Quarters'.  
* **Instructions:** You have 15 minutes to get comfortable with creating a visual plan.

# **Partner Discussion: The Stakeholder Conversation**

## **Partner Discussion**

* Find a partner and share your mini-roadmap.  
* Discuss the following question:  
  * "What is one takeaway on how this aids stakeholder communication?"

**Goal:** Practice articulating the strategic value of the roadmap.

# **Module Recap**

## **Key Concepts Mastered**

* **Strategic Communication:** You can now visually communicate your long-term plan.  
* **Timeline Visualization:** You understand how to use the roadmap to show the timing of your epics.  
* **Stakeholder Alignment:** You have a tool to facilitate conversations about priorities and schedules.

# The Bridge from Plan to Production

![GitLab Logo](https://about.gitlab.com/images/press/logo/png/gitlab-icon-rgb.png) + ![Veloz Logo](https://img1.wsimg.com/isteam/ip/55a4d049-b669-44b1-befb-5cbb852ac163/Veloz-Logo.svg/:/rs=w:59,h:59,cg:true,m/cr=w:59,h:59/qt=q:100/ll)


# From 'Why' and 'When' to 'How'

* In the last modules, we focused on strategic planning (Epics, Roadmaps).
* Now, we shift to the technical execution that brings those plans to life.
* A solid branching strategy is the foundation for collaboration and automation.

*(Graphic: A simple icon showing a roadmap on the left transforming into a code branch icon on the right.)*

# Why a Branching Strategy Matters

# Bringing Order to Collaboration

A consistent strategy prevents:
* Confusing code history
* Difficult merge conflicts
* Uncertainty about what's "production-ready"

**Key Takeaway:** The goal is a predictable, low-friction process for shipping value.

# Common Branching Models

# A Look at Popular Workflows

| GitHub Flow | Trunk-Based Development | GitLab Flow |
|-------------|-------------------------|-------------|
| **Concept:** Simple, `main` is always deployable. Branch from `main` for any work. | **Concept:** All developers work on a single `main` branch, integrating daily. | **Concept:** More structured with environment or release branches. |
| **Best for:** Continuous deployment. | **Best for:** High-maturity teams with robust automated testing. | **Best for:** Scheduled releases and version control. |

# Our Focus: The GitLab Flow

# Built for Traceability

* Provides excellent traceability from issue to code.
* Connects planning features with development work.
* Creates a clear separation between completed code and deployed code.

*(Graphic: A diagram showing a flow: Feature Branch -> Main Branch -> Production Branch)*

# The Power of a Naming Convention

# Context at a Glance

A well-named branch provides instant context.
* **Our Convention:** `[issue-number]-[short-description]`
* **Example:** `45-fix-profile-picture-upload`

**Key Insight:** This simple pattern creates clarity and predictability for the whole team.

# Activity: The Branch Naming Challenge

# Name That Branch!

* We will now practice naming branches for different scenarios.
* Use our convention: `[issue-number]-[short-description]`
* I will present three scenarios. Your task is to create the perfect branch name for each.

# Scenario 1: The Bug Fix

*(Graphic: A large bug icon)*

* **Issue #45:** "User profile picture fails to upload"
* **Task:** Create a branch to fix this bug.
* **What is your branch name?**

# Scenario 2: The New Feature

*(Graphic: A large "new feature" or lightbulb icon)*

* **Issue #78:** "Add Google single sign-on (SSO) to login page"
* **Task:** Create a branch to develop this new feature.
* **What is your branch name?**

# Scenario 3: The Doc Update

*(Graphic: A large documentation or text file icon)*

* **Issue #102:** "Update a dependency in the API documentation"
* **Task:** Create a branch for this documentation update.
* **What is your branch name?**

# Module Recap

# Key Concepts Mastered

* **Branching Workflows:** You understand the principles behind popular strategies like GitLab Flow.
* **Traceability:** You can apply GitLab Flow to connect issues directly to code branches.
* **Naming Conventions:** You can create consistent and descriptive branch names.

# What's Next? The Bridge to Automation

* Our consistent branching strategy is the key that unlocks automation.
* When you create a merge request from a well-named branch, you can automatically trigger a CI/CD pipeline.
* **Coming up in Module 9:** We will build that pipeline.

![GitLab Logo](https://about.gitlab.com/images/press/logo/png/gitlab-icon-rgb.png) + ![Veloz Logo](https://img1.wsimg.com/isteam/ip/55a4d049-b669-44b1-befb-5cbb852ac163/Veloz-Logo.svg/:/rs=w:59,h:59,cg:true,m/cr=w:59,h:59/qt=q:100/ll)


# **The Payoff for Good Branching**

## **From Branch to Automated Pipeline**

* In our last module, we created a clean, consistent branching strategy.  
* Now, we see the payoff: **Automation**.  
* CI/CD is the automated system that runs on the bridge we built.

*(Graphic: A simple flow diagram showing: Branch \-\> Merge Request \-\> Pipeline)*

# **What is CI/CD?**

## **The Two Halves of Automation**

| Continuous Integration (CI) | Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD) |
| :---- | :---- |
| The practice of frequently merging code changes. | Takes over after CI passes. |
| Automatically runs builds and tests after each change. | Automatically deploys your code to staging or production. |
| **Goal:** Detect issues as early as possible. It's your "safety net." | **Goal:** Release new features to users quickly and reliably. |

Export to Sheets

# **The Heart of the Pipeline: `.gitlab-ci.yml`**

## **The Recipe for Your Automation**

* GitLab CI/CD is controlled by a single file in your repository: `.gitlab-ci.yml`.  
* This file is the "recipe" that tells GitLab what to do.  
* **Key Components:**  
  * `stages`: Defines the order of execution (e.g., build, then test, then deploy).  
  * `jobs`: The individual commands to be executed within a stage.

*(Graphic: A simple icon of a text file with `.gitlab-ci.yml` written on it.)*

# **Live Demo: A Pipeline in Action**

## **See the Automation**

* We will now see how a pipeline runs automatically.  
* **Focus Areas:**  
  * Reviewing a pre-existing `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.  
  * Creating a branch and merge request to trigger the pipeline.  
  * Watching the pipeline graph and its stages.  
  * Seeing security scan and code coverage results in the merge request.

*(Graphic: A large GitLab logo or a "play button" icon.)*

# **Activity: Create Your First Pipeline\!**

## **Your Turn to Automate**

* We are now going to build a simple, two-stage pipeline from scratch.  
* The goal is to see how approachable the basic structure is.  
* **Please navigate to:** `Project -> CI/CD -> Editor`

# **Activity Step 1: Define Your Stages**

## **Setting the Order**

* The `stages` keyword defines the overall order of execution.  
* Add this to the top of your file in the editor:  
  YAML  
* **Key Insight:** This ensures all `build` jobs finish before any `test` jobs begin.

# **Activity Step 2: The Build Job**

## **Building the Project**

* A `job` is a set of commands. Let's create our first one.  
* Add this below your stages:  
  YAML  
* **Explanation:** We've named the job `build_project` and assigned it to the `build` stage.

# **Activity Step 3: The Test Job**

## **Testing the Code**

* Now, let's add a job for the `test` stage.  
* Add this to the bottom of your file:  
  YAML  
* **Explanation:** This job, `run_tests`, will only run after `build_project` succeeds.

# **Activity Step 4: Commit and Watch it Run\!**

## **See the Magic**

* Commit your new `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.  
* Navigate to **CI/CD \> Pipelines**.  
* You should see your new pipeline running\!  
* Click on it to watch your stages and jobs execute in real-time.

*(Graphic: An icon of a rocket launching with "Success\!" text.)*

# **Module Recap**

## **Key Concepts Mastered**

* **CI/CD Concepts:** You understand the purpose of Continuous Integration and Delivery.  
* **The Pipeline Recipe:** You can define a basic pipeline using `.gitlab-ci.yml` with stages and jobs.  
* **Automation in Action:** You know how a pipeline is triggered and can read its graph.  
* **Hands-On Creation:** You have successfully created your first automated pipeline.

# **What's Next? Extending the Pipeline**

## **The GitLab Ecosystem**

* Our simple pipeline is just the beginning.  
* In our final module, we'll explore how to connect our pipeline to other tools your team uses every day.  
* **Coming up in Module 10:** Integrations with Slack, Jira, ServiceNow, and more.

# **Beyond the Platform**

## **No Tool is an Island**

* We have built a powerful, self-contained system in GitLab.  
* Now, let's connect it to the other tools you use every day.  
* **The Goal:** Create a seamless flow of information across your entire workflow, reducing manual work and increasing visibility.

# **Where to Find Integrations**

## **Your Connection Hub**

* Integrations are managed at the project or group level.  
* **Navigation Path:** `Project -> Settings -> Integrations`  
* Each integration connects a GitLab event (e.g., code push, failed pipeline) to another application.

*(Graphic: A clean screenshot of the GitLab Integrations settings page, showing the list of available services.)*

# **Popular Integration: Slack**

## **Real-Time Notifications Where You Work**

* **What it does:** Sends automated messages to specific Slack channels for GitLab events.  
* **Events:**  
  * New merge requests  
  * Comments on issues  
  * Failed CI/CD pipelines  
* **Why it's valuable:** It brings critical information to your team's communication hub for faster response times.

*(Graphic: The Slack logo connected to the GitLab logo with a notification icon between them.)*

# **Popular Integration: Jira**

## **Bridging Planning and Development**

* **What it does:** Creates a powerful, two-way link between GitLab commits or merge requests and Jira issues.  
* **How it works:** Mention a Jira issue ID in a commit, and GitLab automatically adds a linked comment back in the corresponding Jira ticket.  
* **Why it's valuable:** Keeps both systems in sync without manual effort. Developers can stay in GitLab, while project managers get full visibility in Jira.

*(Graphic: The Jira logo and GitLab logo with a two-way arrow between them.)*

# **Popular Integration: ServiceNow**

## **Automating Change Management**

* **What it does:** Connects the GitLab deployment workflow to formal change management processes in ServiceNow.  
* **How it works:** A merge request can automatically create a change request. The CI/CD pipeline can then pause and wait for approval in ServiceNow before deploying.  
* **Why it's valuable:** Automates compliance and approval workflows, ensuring a full and auditable trail for every deployment.

*(Graphic: The ServiceNow logo and GitLab logo with a "check mark/approval" icon between them.)*

# **Activity: Brainstorm Your Ideal Integration**

## **What Tool Would YOU Integrate Next?**

* Think about the tools you use every day alongside GitLab.  
* What information do you manually copy between systems?  
* What status updates could be automated?  
* Where is the biggest point of friction in your current workflow?

**Instructions:** In small groups, identify one tool and what you'd want the integration to do.

# **Share Back**

## **Let's Hear Your Ideas**

* What tool did you choose?  
* Why would it be a game-changer for your team?  
* What problem does it solve?

*(Graphic: A large speech bubble or discussion icon.)*

# **Module Recap**

## **Key Concepts Mastered**

* **Ecosystem Awareness:** You know where to find and configure integrations in GitLab.  
* **Popular Use Cases:** You understand the value of connecting GitLab with tools like Slack, Jira, and ServiceNow.  
* **Workflow Optimization:** You can identify opportunities to automate and streamline your team's specific toolchain.

# **The Journey's End**

## **A Complete, Integrated System**

* You now have a complete system to take an idea from planning all the way to production with visibility, collaboration, and automation.  
* This connected workflow is the foundation for a high-performing team.
