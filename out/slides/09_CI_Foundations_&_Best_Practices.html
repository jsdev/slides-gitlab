Kanban board with columns \"To Do,\" \"In Progress,\" \"Done.\")*\n\n# **The Problem: Generic Boards Tell a Vague Story**\n\n## **The Generic Board**\n\nA large, simple graphic showing three columns:\n\n* **To Do**  \n* **In Progress**  \n* **Done**\n\n**Caption below:** This gives a high-level view but doesn't map to your team's actual process.\n\n# **The Solution: Workflow-Specific

Backlog  \n* Ready for Development  \n* In Progress  \n* Code Review  \n* Testing  \n* Ready for Deploy  \n* Done\n\n**Key Takeaway:** Your board should be a mirror of your real process, not a generic template.\n\n# **Live Demo: Building Our Workflow Board**\n\n## **Live Demo**\n\nWe will now build a \"Development Workflow\" board together.\n\n* **Focus Areas:**  \n  * Creating columns that match a real development process.  \n  * Using labels and milestones to filter each list.  \n  * Applying board-wide filters to create a focused view.\n\n*(Graphic: A large GitLab logo or a screenshot icon.)*\n\n# **A New Dimension: Swimlanes**\n\n## **Visualizing Work from Multiple Angles**\n\n* Think of swimlanes as horizontal slices across your workflow columns.  \n* They allow you to group your work by another dimension.\n\n*(Graphic: A simple diagram showing vertical columns for \"Workflow\" and horizontal rows cutting across them labeled \"Swimlanes.\")*\n\n# **Common Swimlane Dimensions**\n\n## **How Do You Want to Group Your Work?**\n\n* **By Epic:** See how each epic progresses through your workflow.  \n* **By Assignee:** Instantly see each team member's workload across all stages.  \n* **By Priority:** Track how high, medium, and low priority work is flowing.  \n* **By Team:** See how work moves between different functional teams (Frontend, Backend, QA).\n\n*(Icons beside each bullet point representing the concept.)*\n\n# **Example: Swimlanes by Epic**\n\n## **Strategic and Tactical View in One**\n\n**Key Insights Gained:**\n\n* Which epics are moving smoothly through development.  \n* Which epics are stalled in a specific stage like code review.  \n* Which epics are ready for deployment.\n\n*(Graphic: A screenshot or mock-up of a GitLab board with clear horizontal swimlanes labeled \"Epic 1: User Authentication\" and \"Epic 2: Profile Redesign.\")*\n\n# **Optimizing Flow with WIP Limits**\n\n## **Stop Starting, Start Finishing**\n\n* Work-in-Progress (WIP) limits prevent your team from starting too much work at once.  \n* The theory is simple:  \n   **Limited WIP \\= Faster Flow**\n\n*(Graphic: An icon of a \"Stop\" sign or a \"funnel\" to represent limiting work.)*\n\n# **Why Limit WIP?**\n\n## **The Benefits of Focus**\n\n* **Reduces Context Switching:** Every additional task reduces overall efficiency.  \n* **Improves Quality:** Rushed work creates more bugs and rework.  \n* **Exposes Bottlenecks:** Limits clearly show where your workflow is getting stuck.  \n* **Prevents Burnout:** Overloaded teams are stressed and less effective.\n\n# **Setting WIP Limits in GitLab**\n\n## **A Conscious Decision**\n\n* When you exceed a WIP limit, GitLab shows a warning but does not block the action.  \n* This makes breaking the rule a conscious team decision, not an accident.\n\n*(Graphic: A screenshot of a board with numbers (e.g., 3/4) on top of the \"In Progress\" and \"Code Review\" columns, with one column highlighted in orange to show the warning.)*\n\n# **Specialized Boards: One Size Fits None**\n\n## **Different Views for Different Roles**\n\n* The same set of issues can be viewed through different boards, each tailored for a specific purpose or role.\n\n*(Graphic: A central icon representing \"All Issues\" with arrows pointing to smaller board icons labeled \"Developer View,\" \"QA View,\" and \"PM View.\")*\n\n# **Example: The Product Manager Board**\n\n## **View for Strategic Tracking**\n\n* **Columns:** Backlog, Sprint Ready, In Progress, Done  \n* **Swimlanes:** Epic  \n* **Filter:**

\n3. **Option 3:** Build a Specialized Purpose Board (Bug Triage, Sprint Planning)\n\n**You have 10 minutes to build and configure a board.**\n\n# **Module Recap**\n\n## **Key Concepts Mastered**\n\n* **Workflow-Specific Boards:** You can create columns that match real processes.  \n* **Swimlanes:** You can visualize multiple dimensions of work simultaneously.  \n* **WIP Limits:** You know how to prevent overload and optimize flow.  \n* **Specialized Views:** You can create role-specific and purpose-built boards.  \n* **Flow Optimization:** You understand how boards drive process improvement.\n\n# **Your Action Items**\n\n## **Putting It Into Practice**\n\n* **This Week:** Replace your generic boards with workflow-specific ones.  \n* **Next Week:** Implement WIP limits and train your team on flow principles.  \n* **This Month:** Create specialized boards for different roles and measure flow improvements.\n\n#
