# Today's Goals

* **Create** sprint, release, and project milestones that drive your workflow.  
* **Use** GitLab's burndown charts to track progress in real-time.  
* **Build** milestone templates that save hours of sprint planning.  
* **Connect** milestones to your broader release planning strategy.

# What is a Milestone?

## A Time-Based Container for Your Work

* Milestones are more than just deadlines; they are flexible containers for different types of work cycles.  
* They transform your sprints from intuition-based efforts into data-driven workflows.

# The Three Types of Milestones

From Daily Sprints to Strategic Projects

| Sprint Milestones | Release Milestones | Project Milestones |  |  |  |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
|  | **Duration:** 1-3 weeks |  | **Duration:** 4-8 weeks |  | **Duration:** 2-6 months |
|  | **Purpose:** Deliver working software incrementally |  | **Purpose:** Deliver cohesive features to users |  | **Purpose:** Achieve strategic business objectives |
|  | **Example Name:** 'Sprint 2024.01' |  | **Example Name:** 'Release v2.1.0' |  | **Example Name:** 'Mobile App Launch' |


# The Milestone Hierarchy

## A clear chain from daily work to strategic goals.

Project milestones contain release milestones, which contain sprint milestones.

# Anatomy of a Sprint Milestone

## Your Sprint Charter

A great milestone is more than just a title and a due date. It's a complete container with goals, capacity, and success criteria.

* **Sprint Goal:** What are we trying to achieve?  
* **Sprint Capacity:** How much work can we realistically do?  
* **Success Criteria:** How do we know we were successful?  
* **Sprint Schedule:** What are our key dates and meetings?  
* **Definition of Done:** A reminder of our quality standards.

# Making Sprints Predictable

## Capacity Planning & Burndown Charts

*(This is a transition slide to Part B of the module.)*

# Capacity Planning: The Formula

## From Guesswork to a Data-Driven Estimate

**Formula:** `Team Size x Sprint Duration x Availability = Total Capacity`

**Example:** 5 developers √ó 8 story points/sprint √ó 0.8 availability \= **32 story points** of capacity.

# Introducing: The Burndown Chart

## Your Visual Progress Tracker

This chart shows three critical pieces of information:

1. **Ideal Burndown (gray line):** The perfect path to completion.  
2. **Actual Burndown (colored line):** Your team's real progress.  
3. **Scope Changes (vertical jumps):** When work is added or removed.

# Interpreting Burndown Patterns

## From Healthy to Crisis at a Glance

| Healthy Patterns ‚úÖ | Warning Signs ‚ö†Ô∏è | Crisis Indicators üö® |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Actual line tracks close to ideal. | Flat lines (no progress). | Burndown line goes UP. |
| Steady downward progress. | Actual line is consistently above ideal. | Massive gap between actual and ideal. |


# Beyond Burndown: Other Health Metrics

## A Complete Picture of Sprint Health

* **Completion Rate:** Percentage of committed stories completed.  
* **On-Time Delivery:** Stories completed by their due dates.  
* **Velocity Trending:** Story points completed per sprint over time.  
* **Cycle Time:** Average time from 'In Progress' to 'Done'.

# Release Planning with Milestones

## The Bigger Picture

Use a `Release Milestone` to group your sprints and track progress towards a major feature delivery.

**Release Milestone Template:**

* **Release Goal:** What is the overall objective?  
* **Release Scope:** Which epics are included?  
* **Quality Gates:** What are the exit criteria?  
* **Release Schedule:** What are the key deployment dates?

# Power-User Tips for Milestones

## Work Smarter, Not Harder

* **Bulk Issue Management:** Use issue boards to drag-and-drop issues between milestones.  
* **Milestone Templates:** Save your detailed milestone descriptions as templates for reuse.  
* **Integration with Labels:** Create powerful filters and saved searches like `milestone:current AND label:blocked`.  
* **Group-Level Milestones:** Create milestones at the group level for organization-wide initiatives.
