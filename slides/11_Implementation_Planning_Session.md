# Today's Agenda

* **Assess** your current GitLab usage and identify gaps
* **Prioritize** which modules to implement first
* **Create** a 90-day implementation roadmap
* **Define** success metrics and checkpoints
* **Assign** ownership and accountability

# Current State Assessment

## Where Are You Today?

Let's evaluate your team's current GitLab maturity across the key areas we've covered:

* **Issue Management:** Basic vs. Rich structured issues
* **Labeling System:** Ad-hoc vs. Strategic scoped labels
* **Board Configuration:** Generic vs. Workflow-specific
* **Time Tracking:** Manual vs. Integrated
* **Epic Usage:** None vs. Strategic themes
* **Milestone Planning:** Informal vs. Data-driven sprints

# Implementation Priority Matrix

## Impact vs. Effort Analysis

| High Impact, Low Effort | High Impact, High Effort |
|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Quick Wins** - Start here | **Strategic Projects** - Plan carefully |
| • Scoped label system | • Epic hierarchy implementation |
| • Issue templates | • Advanced board configurations |
| • Basic time tracking | • Full roadmap integration |

| Low Impact, Low Effort | Low Impact, High Effort |
|------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Fill-ins** - Do when time allows | **Avoid** - Not worth the investment |
| • UI customizations | • Over-engineered workflows |
| • Nice-to-have integrations | • Complex automation too early |

# Your 90-Day Roadmap Template

## Phase 1: Foundation (Days 1-30)

**Week 1-2: Issue & Label Foundation**
* Implement scoped label system
* Create issue templates
* Train team on rich issue creation

**Week 3-4: Basic Workflow**
* Configure workflow-specific boards
* Implement basic time tracking
* Establish milestone planning process

# Phase 2: Optimization (Days 31-60)

**Week 5-6: Advanced Boards**
* Implement swimlanes
* Set WIP limits
* Create role-specific board views

**Week 7-8: Strategic Planning**
* Begin epic implementation
* Connect epics to milestones
* Start basic roadmap usage

# Phase 3: Integration (Days 61-90)

**Week 9-10: Automation & CI/CD**
* Implement branching strategy
* Create basic CI/CD pipelines
* Automate common workflows

**Week 11-12: Ecosystem Integration**
* Connect key external tools
* Optimize reporting and metrics
* Full team adoption and training

# Success Metrics & Checkpoints

## How Will You Measure Success?

**30-Day Checkpoint:**
* 100% of issues use templates and proper labels
* Team velocity baseline established
* Basic boards configured and in use

**60-Day Checkpoint:**
* Epic-driven planning implemented
* Advanced board features adopted
* Time tracking data being used for planning

**90-Day Checkpoint:**
* Full CI/CD pipeline operational
* Key integrations functional
* Team self-sufficient with new processes
