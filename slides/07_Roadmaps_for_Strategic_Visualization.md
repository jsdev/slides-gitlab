# **Connecting the Dots**

## **From Tactical Execution to Strategic Vision**

A visual flow diagram showing the progression of concepts learned so far: `Issues` (The What) \-\> `Boards` (The How) \-\> `Epics` (The Initiative) \-\> **`Roadmaps` (The When)**

**Key Takeaway:** We know *what* we're working on. Now, let's communicate *when* it will be delivered.

# **What is a Roadmap?**

## **The "Big Picture" Timeline**

* A roadmap is a dynamic, high-level timeline view of your epics.  
* It answers key stakeholder questions about timing and delivery schedules.  
* It transforms your detailed plans into an easy-to-understand visual story.

# **Answering Stakeholder Questions**

## **From "What's the Status?" to "Here's the Plan"**

A list of questions that roadmaps help answer:

* "What major initiatives are planned for Q3?"  
* "When can we expect the 'Customer Portal Redesign' to be complete?"  
* "Are there any overlaps in our upcoming feature releases?"

# **The Anatomy of a GitLab Roadmap**

## **Key Features of the Roadmap View**

* **Timeline View:** Adjust between Weeks, Months, and Quarters.  
* **Epic Bars:** Each bar represents an epic, with its length determined by start and due dates.  
* **Progress Indicators:** See completion percentage directly on the epic bar.  
* **Milestone Overlays:** Visualize how releases align with your strategic initiatives.

# **Live Demo: Exploring the Roadmap**

## **Live Demo**

* We will now explore the **Epics \> Roadmap** view together.  
* **Focus Areas:**  
  * Adjusting the timeline view.  
  * Viewing epic details and progress.  
  * Dragging and dropping to adjust epic timelines.

# **Activity: Build a Mini Roadmap**

## **Activity: Build Your Mini Roadmap**

* **Your Task:**  
  1. Navigate to the **Epics \> Roadmap** view.  
  2. Find at least three epics and ensure they have start and due dates.  
  3. Practice adjusting the timeline by dragging the epic bars.  
  4. Switch the view between 'Months' and 'Quarters'.  
* **Instructions:** You have 15 minutes to get comfortable with creating a visual plan.

# **Partner Discussion: The Stakeholder Conversation**

## **Partner Discussion**

* Find a partner and share your mini-roadmap.  
* Discuss the following question:  
  * "What is one takeaway on how this aids stakeholder communication?"

**Goal:** Practice articulating the strategic value of the roadmap.

# **Module Recap**

## **Key Concepts Mastered**

* **Strategic Communication:** You can now visually communicate your long-term plan.  
* **Timeline Visualization:** You understand how to use the roadmap to show the timing of your epics.  
* **Stakeholder Alignment:** You have a tool to facilitate conversations about priorities and schedules.

## **The Complete GitLab Workflow**

An updated version of the flow diagram from Slide 2, now showing the complete picture: `Issues` \-\> `Labels` \-\> `Boards` \-\> `Milestones` \-\> `Epics` \-\> **`Roadmaps`**

**Key Takeaway:** Each GitLab feature builds on the last to create a single, integrated system from idea to delivery.
