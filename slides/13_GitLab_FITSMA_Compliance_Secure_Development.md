# What is FITSMA?
## Federal Information Technology Security Management Act of 2002

### Purpose & Scope:
* **Strengthens security** of federal information systems and networks
* **Governs IT security** within US Federal government and connected organizations

* **Emphasizes continuous monitoring** vs. one-time security checks

### Why It Matters for Development:
* ✅ **Mandatory compliance** for government projects
* ✅ **Risk-based approach** to security implementation
* ✅ **Continuous assessment** requirements
* ✅ **Clear accountability** for security decisions


# FITSMA Core Requirements
## Essential Security Framework Components

| Requirement | Description | Implementation Focus |
|-------------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Risk Assessments** | Regular identification and evaluation of security risks | Ongoing process, not one-time event |
| **Security Controls** | Technical, administrative, and physical safeguards | Multi-layered defense approach |
| **Security Training** | Personnel education on policies and procedures | Continuous awareness programs |
| **Incident Response** | Detection, reporting, and response procedures | Rapid response capabilities |

# FIPS 199 Security Categorization
## Understanding Impact Levels for Your Systems

### Impact Classification System:

**Low Impact**
* Limited impact on organizational operations, assets, or individuals
* Minor inconvenience if compromised
* Basic security controls required

**Moderate Impact** 
* Serious impact on operations or individuals
* Significant financial or operational consequences
* Enhanced security controls required

**High Impact**
* Severe or catastrophic impact
* National security implications or loss of life potential
* Most stringent security controls required

#### **Key Principle**: Higher categorization = More rigorous GitLab configuration


# NIST Framework Integration
## Your Implementation Roadmap

### Critical NIST Publications:

**NIST 800-53**: Security and Privacy Controls Catalog
* Comprehensive catalog of security controls
* Choose appropriate controls based on system categorization
* Technical implementation specifications

**NIST 800-37**: Risk Management Framework (RMF)
* Step-by-step implementation process
* Lifecycle approach to security management
* Continuous authorization methodology

#### **Remember**: FITSMA = Law | NIST = Implementation Guide


# Risk Management Framework (RMF)
## Six-Step Security Lifecycle

```
1. CATEGORIZE → 2. SELECT → 3. IMPLEMENT → 4. ASSESS → 5. AUTHORIZE → 6. MONITOR
     ↓              ↓           ↓             ↓           ↓             ↓
Define System   Choose      Deploy        Verify      Authorize    Continuous
& Requirements  Controls    Controls      Effectiveness Operation   Monitoring
```

### GitLab Maps to Every RMF Step:
