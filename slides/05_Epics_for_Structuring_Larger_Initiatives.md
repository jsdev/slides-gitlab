# **Today's Goals**

* **Create epics** that connect business strategy to daily work.  
* **Structure epic hierarchies** that make sense for your organization.  
* **Use epic boards** to visualize strategic progress.  
* **Connect epics to roadmaps** for stakeholder communication.  
* **Track epic progress** across multiple teams and milestones.

# **What is an Epic?**

## **The Chapters in Your Product Story**

If issues are the individual pages, epics are the chapters that group them together into a coherent story.

* Epics are strategic themes or initiatives.  
* They help you track progress on large features that span multiple sprints.  
* They are containers for related issues that together deliver a meaningful business outcome.

# **Epic vs. Issue**

## **A Quick Comparison**

A simple guideline: If it can be done in one sprint, it's likely an issue. If it takes multiple sprints to deliver a full experience, it's a great candidate for an epic.

| Issues | Epics |
| :---- | :---- |
| Specific, actionable work items | Strategic themes or initiatives |
| Completed in days or weeks | Completed over weeks or months |
| Technical or task-focused | Business outcome-focused |
| Assigned to individuals or small teams | Involve multiple people or teams |

# **The Epic Hierarchy**

## **Tracking Progress at Every Level**

GitLab supports nested epics, allowing you to connect high-level strategy directly to individual tasks.

*(Graphic: A top-down flow chart showing the hierarchy)*

* **Portfolio Epic** (e.g., 'Q1 2024 Digital Transformation')  
  * **Program Epic** (e.g., 'Customer Portal Redesign')  
    * **Feature Epic** (e.g., 'User Authentication System')  
      * **Issue** (e.g., 'Implement OAuth login')

# **Anatomy of an Epic**

## **A Charter for Your Initiative**

A well-structured epic acts as the single source of truth for a major initiative.

Key Sections:

* **Epic Overview:** What is this initiative and why does it matter?  
* **Business Objectives:** What is the primary goal and how will success be measured?  
* **Scope (In & Out):** What is explicitly included and excluded?  
* **Success Criteria:** A checklist of what "done" looks like for the entire epic.  
* **Dependencies:** What does this epic block, and what is it blocked by?  
* **Stakeholders:** Who is the sponsor, owner, and lead?

# **Epic Templates**

## **Drive Consistency Across Your Organization**

Just like with issues, you can create templates for your epics. This is crucial for ensuring every major initiative starts with the same strategic context and structure.

# **Visualizing Strategy: Epic Boards**

## **Kanban for Your Initiatives**

Epic boards are like issue boards but for visualizing strategic progress.

They help you:

* Track strategic initiatives at a glance.  
* Visualize epic progress across different states (e.g., Backlog, In Progress, Done).  
* Identify bottlenecks at the strategic level.

# **Visualizing Timelines: Roadmaps**

## **Communicating Your Plan Over Time**

Roadmaps turn your epics into strategic communication tools.

* They provide a high-level timeline view of your epics.  
* They help you communicate strategic direction to stakeholders.  
* They allow you to track progress against strategic goals.

*(This is a preview of a premium feature that will be covered in more detail in Module 7.)*

# **The Full Picture**

## **How It All Connects**

Each GitLab feature builds on the last to create a complete project management system.
