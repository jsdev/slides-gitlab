# Beyond the Platform

## No Tool is an Island

* We have built a powerful, self-contained system in GitLab.  
* Now, let's connect it to the other tools you use every day.  
* **The Goal:** Create a seamless flow of information across your entire workflow, reducing manual work and increasing visibility.

# Where to Find Integrations

## Your Connection Hub

* Integrations are managed at the project or group level.  
* **Navigation Path:** `Project -> Settings -> Integrations`  
* Each integration connects a GitLab event (e.g., code push, failed pipeline) to another application.

# Popular Integration: Slack

## Real-Time Notifications Where You Work

* **What it does:** Sends automated messages to specific Slack channels for GitLab events.  
* **Events:**  
  * New merge requests  
  * Comments on issues  
  * Failed CI/CD pipelines  
* **Why it's valuable:** It brings critical information to your team's communication hub for faster response times.

# Popular Integration: Jira

## Bridging Planning and Development

* **What it does:** Creates a powerful, two-way link between GitLab commits or merge requests and Jira issues.  
* **How it works:** Mention a Jira issue ID in a commit, and GitLab automatically adds a linked comment back in the corresponding Jira ticket.  
* **Why it's valuable:** Keeps both systems in sync without manual effort. Developers can stay in GitLab, while project managers get full visibility in Jira.

# Popular Integration: ServiceNow

## Automating Change Management

* **What it does:** Connects the GitLab deployment workflow to formal change management processes in ServiceNow.  
* **How it works:** A merge request can automatically create a change request. The CI/CD pipeline can then pause and wait for approval in ServiceNow before deploying.  
* **Why it's valuable:** Automates compliance and approval workflows, ensuring a full and auditable trail for every deployment.

# Activity: Brainstorm Your Ideal Integration

## What Tool Would YOU Integrate Next?

* Think about the tools you use every day alongside GitLab.  
* What information do you manually copy between systems?  
* What status updates could be automated?  
* Where is the biggest point of friction in your current workflow?

**Instructions:** In small groups, identify one tool and what you'd want the integration to do.

# Share Back

## Let's Hear Your Ideas

* What tool did you choose?  
* Why would it be a game-changer for your team?  
* What problem does it solve?
