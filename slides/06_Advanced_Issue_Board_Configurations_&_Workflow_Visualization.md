# **Can You Answer These Questions Instantly?**

* What's blocked and why?  
* What's ready for the next team member?  
* Who is overloaded and who has capacity?  
* What's taking too long in each stage?

*(Graphic: On the left, a simple, generic Kanban board with columns "To Do," "In Progress," "Done.")*

# **The Problem: Generic Boards Tell a Vague Story**

## **The Generic Board**

A large, simple graphic showing three columns:

* **To Do**  
* **In Progress**  
* **Done**

**Caption below:** This gives a high-level view but doesn't map to your team's actual process.

# **The Solution: Workflow-Specific Boards**

## **Mirror Your Team's Real Process**

A side-by-side comparison.

**Left Side (Generic):**

* To Do  
* In Progress  
* Done

**Right Side (Software Dev Workflow):**

* Backlog  
* Ready for Development  
* In Progress  
* Code Review  
* Testing  
* Ready for Deploy  
* Done

**Key Takeaway:** Your board should be a mirror of your real process, not a generic template.

# **Live Demo: Building Our Workflow Board**

## **Live Demo**

We will now build a "Development Workflow" board together.

* **Focus Areas:**  
  * Creating columns that match a real development process.  
  * Using labels and milestones to filter each list.  
  * Applying board-wide filters to create a focused view.

# **A New Dimension: Swimlanes**

## **Visualizing Work from Multiple Angles**

* Think of swimlanes as horizontal slices across your workflow columns.  
* They allow you to group your work by another dimension.

*(Graphic: A simple diagram showing vertical columns for "Workflow" and horizontal rows cutting across them labeled "Swimlanes.")*

# **Common Swimlane Dimensions**

## **How Do You Want to Group Your Work?**

* **By Epic:** See how each epic progresses through your workflow.  
* **By Assignee:** Instantly see each team member's workload across all stages.  
* **By Priority:** Track how high, medium, and low priority work is flowing.  
* **By Team:** See how work moves between different functional teams (Frontend, Backend, QA).

*(Icons beside each bullet point representing the concept.)*

# **Example: Swimlanes by Epic**

## **Strategic and Tactical View in One**

**Key Insights Gained:**

* Which epics are moving smoothly through development.  
* Which epics are stalled in a specific stage like code review.  
* Which epics are ready for deployment.

*(Graphic: A screenshot or mock-up of a GitLab board with clear horizontal swimlanes labeled "Epic 1: User Authentication" and "Epic 2: Profile Redesign.")*

# **Optimizing Flow with WIP Limits**

## **Stop Starting, Start Finishing**

* Work-in-Progress (WIP) limits prevent your team from starting too much work at once.  
* The theory is simple:  
   **Limited WIP \= Faster Flow**

*(Graphic: An icon of a "Stop" sign or a "funnel" to represent limiting work.)*

# **Why Limit WIP?**

## **The Benefits of Focus**

* **Reduces Context Switching:** Every additional task reduces overall efficiency.  
* **Improves Quality:** Rushed work creates more bugs and rework.  
* **Exposes Bottlenecks:** Limits clearly show where your workflow is getting stuck.  
* **Prevents Burnout:** Overloaded teams are stressed and less effective.

# **Setting WIP Limits in GitLab**

## **A Conscious Decision**

* When you exceed a WIP limit, GitLab shows a warning but does not block the action.  
* This makes breaking the rule a conscious team decision, not an accident.

*(Graphic: A screenshot of a board with numbers (e.g., 3/4) on top of the "In Progress" and "Code Review" columns, with one column highlighted in orange to show the warning.)*

# **Specialized Boards: One Size Fits None**

## **Different Views for Different Roles**

* The same set of issues can be viewed through different boards, each tailored for a specific purpose or role.

*(Graphic: A central icon representing "All Issues" with arrows pointing to smaller board icons labeled "Developer View," "QA View," and "PM View.")*

# **Example: The Product Manager Board**

## **View for Strategic Tracking**

* **Columns:** Backlog, Sprint Ready, In Progress, Done  
* **Swimlanes:** Epic  
* **Filter:** `milestone: "Current Sprint"`  
* **Purpose:** To track sprint progress and the status of major epics.

# **Activity: Build Your Board**

## **Configure Your Team's Workflow Board**

**Choose Your Challenge:**

1. **Option 1:** Perfect Your Development Board  
2. **Option 2:** Create a Role-Specific Board (QA, PM, etc.)  
3. **Option 3:** Build a Specialized Purpose Board (Bug Triage, Sprint Planning)

**You have 10 minutes to build and configure a board.**

# **Module Recap**

## **Key Concepts Mastered**

* **Workflow-Specific Boards:** You can create columns that match real processes.  
* **Swimlanes:** You can visualize multiple dimensions of work simultaneously.  
* **WIP Limits:** You know how to prevent overload and optimize flow.  
* **Specialized Views:** You can create role-specific and purpose-built boards.  
* **Flow Optimization:** You understand how boards drive process improvement.

# **Your Action Items**

## **Putting It Into Practice**

* **This Week:** Replace your generic boards with workflow-specific ones.  
* **Next Week:** Implement WIP limits and train your team on flow principles.  
* **This Month:** Create specialized boards for different roles and measure flow improvements.
