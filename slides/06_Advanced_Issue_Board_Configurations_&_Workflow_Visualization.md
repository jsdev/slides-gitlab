# Can You Answer These Questions Instantly?

* What's blocked and why?  
* What's ready for the next team member?  
* Who is overloaded and who has capacity?  
* What's taking too long in each stage?


# The Problem: Generic Boards Tell a Vague Story

## The Generic Board

A large, simple graphic showing three columns:

* **To Do**  
* **In Progress**  
* **Done**

**Caption below:** This gives a high-level view but doesn't map to your team's actual process.

# The Solution: Workflow-Specific Boards

## Mirror Your Team's Real Process

A side-by-side comparison.

### Left Side (Generic):

* To Do  
* In Progress  
* Done

### Right Side (Software Dev Workflow):

* Backlog  
* Ready for Development  
* In Progress  
* Code Review  
* Testing  
* Ready for Deploy  
* Done

**Key Takeaway:** Your board should be a mirror of your real process, not a generic template.

# Live Demo: Building Our Workflow Board

## Live Demo

We will now build a "Development Workflow" board together.

### Focus Areas:  
* Creating columns that match a real development process.  
* Using labels and milestones to filter each list.  
* Applying board-wide filters to create a focused view.

# A New Dimension: Swimlanes

## Visualizing Work from Multiple Angles

* Think of swimlanes as horizontal slices across your workflow columns.  
* They allow you to group your work by another dimension.


# Common Swimlane Dimensions

## How Do You Want to Group Your Work?

* **By Epic:** See how each epic progresses through your workflow.  
* **By Assignee:** Instantly see each team member's workload across all stages.  
* **By Priority:** Track how high, medium, and low priority work is flowing.  
* **By Team:** See how work moves between different functional teams (Frontend, Backend, QA).

*(Icons beside each bullet point representing the concept.)*

# Example: Swimlanes by Epic

## Strategic and Tactical View in One

### Key Insights Gained:

* Which epics are moving smoothly through development.  
* Which epics are stalled in a specific stage like code review.  
* Which epics are ready for deployment.

# Optimizing Flow with WIP Limits

## Stop Starting, Start Finishing

* Work-in-Progress (WIP) limits prevent your team from starting too much work at once.  
* The theory is simple:  
   **Limited WIP \= Faster Flow**

# Why Limit WIP?

## The Benefits of Focus

* **Reduces Context Switching:** Every additional task reduces overall efficiency.  
* **Improves Quality:** Rushed work creates more bugs and rework.  
* **Exposes Bottlenecks:** Limits clearly show where your workflow is getting stuck.  
* **Prevents Burnout:** Overloaded teams are stressed and less effective.

# Setting WIP Limits in GitLab

## A Conscious Decision

* When you exceed a WIP limit, GitLab shows a warning but does not block the action.  
* This makes breaking the rule a conscious team decision, not an accident.

# Specialized Boards: One Size Fits None

## Different Views for Different Roles

* The same set of issues can be viewed through different boards, each tailored for a specific purpose or role.

# Example: The Product Manager Board

## View for Strategic Tracking

* **Columns:** Backlog, Sprint Ready, In Progress, Done  
* **Swimlanes:** Epic  
* **Filter:** `milestone: "Current Sprint"`  
* **Purpose:** To track sprint progress and the status of major epics.

# Activity: Build Your Board

## Configure Your Team's Workflow Board

### Choose Your Challenge:

1. **Option 1:** Perfect Your Development Board  
2. **Option 2:** Create a Role-Specific Board (QA, PM, etc.)  
3. **Option 3:** Build a Specialized Purpose Board (Bug Triage, Sprint Planning)
4. **You have 10 minutes to build and configure a board.**

# Module Recap

## Key Concepts Mastered

* **Workflow-Specific Boards:** You can create columns that match real processes.  
* **Swimlanes:** You can visualize multiple dimensions of work simultaneously.  
* **WIP Limits:** You know how to prevent overload and optimize flow.  
* **Specialized Views:** You can create role-specific and purpose-built boards.  
* **Flow Optimization:** You understand how boards drive process improvement.

# Your Action Items

## Putting It Into Practice

* **This Week:** Replace your generic boards with workflow-specific ones.  
* **Next Week:** Implement WIP limits and train your team on flow principles.  
* **This Month:** Create specialized boards for different roles and measure flow improvements.
