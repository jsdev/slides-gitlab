# Today's Goals

* **Create rich, structured issues** that actually help your team
* **Track time** without additional tools or spreadsheets
* **Build relationships** between issues to show dependencies
* Use  
   **advanced features** that most teams don't even know exist

# Beyond a Title & Description

## Moving from a simple task to a shared understanding.

A great issue is more than just a title. It's a "contract" that contains everything needed to get the work done. We can achieve this with structured markdown.

# Anatomy of a Rich Issue

Example: "Implement User Authentication"

* **User Story:** As a \[user\], I want \[action\], so that \[benefit\].
* **Business Value:** Why are we building this?
* **Acceptance Criteria:** A checklist of what "done" looks like.
* **Technical Notes:** Guidance for the developer.
* **Definition of Done:** Team-wide quality checklist.

# Adding Rich Metadata

## Context at a Glance

Use the sidebar to add crucial context to every issue.

* **(Icon) Assignees:** Assign multiple people for pair programming or collaboration.
* **(Icon) Milestone:** Connect the issue to a sprint or release.
* **(Icon) Due Date:** Set a clear deadline.
* **(Icon) Labels:** Categorize the work (e.g., bug, feature, backend).
* **(Icon) Weight:** Estimate effort using story points.

# Task Lists: Your Interactive Checklist

## Two pieces of magic in one feature.

1. **Live Progress Tracking:** GitLab automatically tracks the completion percentage as you check items off.
2. **Create Linked Issues:** Convert any task list item into its own issue with a single click, automatically linking it back to the original story.

# Issue Relationships: Visualizing Dependencies

See what's blocking progress instantly.

| Relationship | Purpose |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Related to** | A general connection; these issues are similar but not dependent. |
| **Blocks** | This issue must be finished before the other one can start. |
| **Blocked by** | This issue cannot start until the other one is finished. |


# Issue Templates: Work Smarter

Ensure consistency and save time.

* Create reusable templates for common issue types like bug reports or user stories.
* When anyone creates a new issue, they can select a template to pre-fill the description with the required structure.


# Integrated Time Tracking

## Ditch the Spreadsheets

* GitLab's time tracking is built right into issues.
* It connects directly to your workflow and generates reports automatically.
* No more separate systems or manual data entry.

# Time Tracking with Quick Actions

Use slash commands in comments to log time.

To Estimate Time:

/estimate 2d 4h 30m

To Log Time Spent:

/spend 2h Working on login validation

To Correct Time:

/spend \-30m


# Where Does the Data Go? Time Reports

## Visualize your team's effort.

* **Issue List View:** See Time Estimate vs. Time Spent for every issue.
* **Milestone Reports:** Get a roll-up of all time tracked for an entire sprint.
* **User Reports:** Understand team capacity and velocity.

# Time Tracking Best Practices

Use data for learning, not for punishment.

| DO ✅ | DON'T ❌ |
| :---- | :---- |
| Estimate during sprint planning. | Get obsessed with perfect accuracy. |
| Log time daily. | Use it for performance reviews without context. |
| Be consistent with granularity. | Force people to account for every minute. |
| Focus on patterns, not individuals. | Ignore the data; if you don't use it, don't collect it. |
