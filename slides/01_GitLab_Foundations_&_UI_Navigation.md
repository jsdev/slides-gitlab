# **Unlocking Your Potential**

## **Most teams use about 20% of GitLab's capabilities.**

Today, we start unlocking the other 80%.

# **GitLab is Three Tools in One**

## **The Integrated DevOps Platform**

A three-column layout with icons for each section.

| Source Code Management | CI/CD Platform | Project Management Suite |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Your Git repositories. This is where your code lives. | Automated testing and deployment. We'll touch on this on Day 3\. | This is where we'll spend most of our time. The "Plan" capabilities are your secret weapon for Scrum. |

# **A Seamless Flow**

## **From Idea to Production**

* Your user stories become issues.  
* Issues connect to code changes.  
* Code changes trigger deployments.

*(Graphic: A simple flow diagram: `Issue Icon` \-\> `Code Branch Icon` \-\> `Pipeline Icon` \-\> `Rocket Icon`)*

# **UI Navigation: Your Mission Control**

## **The Project Dashboard**

* Shows activity across all your projects.  
* Think of it as your personal news feed for all GitLab activity.  
* **Key Concept:** The left sidebar is context-sensitive; it changes based on whether you're in a Group or a Project.

*(Graphic: A screenshot of the GitLab project dashboard with the left sidebar highlighted.)*

# **Key Sidebar Exploration**

## **Your Toolkit for Planning & Execution**

A visual list of key sidebar items with brief descriptions.

* **Issues:** Your backlog, tasks, and user stories.  
* **Boards:** Your visual workflow (Kanban).  
* **Epics:** Your themes and initiatives (the big picture).  
* **Milestones:** Your sprints, releases, and time boxes.  
* **Roadmaps:** Strategic visualization over time.  
* **Merge Requests:** Where code review happens.  
* **Repository:** Your actual code files and Git history.

# **Groups vs. Projects**

## **Understanding the Hierarchy**

This hierarchy matters because permissions and features work differently at each level.

**Groups**

* Your team, department, or organization.  
* *Analogy: A Folder*

**Projects**

* Individual repositories or work streams.  
* *Analogy: Files inside the folder*

*(Graphic: An icon of a folder labeled "Group" containing three file icons labeled "Project.")*

# **Example Hierarchy**

## **How It Looks in Practice**

**Group: 'Marketing Team'**

* Project: 'Website'  
* Project: 'Campaign Management'  
* Project: 'Analytics Dashboard'

**Group: 'Engineering'**

* Project: 'Frontend App'  
* Project: 'Backend API'  
* Project: 'Mobile App'

# **Activity: Time to Explore**

## **Navigation Practice**

* It's your turn to explore the GitLab UI.  
* The goal is to get comfortable clicking around and seeing what's there.  
* Think of this as a scavenger hunt. Don't worry about understanding everything yet.
