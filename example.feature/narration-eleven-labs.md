## Summary

Add slide narration using Eleven Labs or similar text-to-speech service.

## Motivation

Narration will make presentations more accessible for users with visual impairments and those who prefer audio content.

## Proposed Solution

Integrate Eleven Labs API to generate audio narration for each slide. Provide a play/pause button and allow users to download audio files.

## Alternatives Considered

- Use browser's built-in speech synthesis
- Manual audio recording

## Additional Context

See [Eleven Labs API](https://elevenlabs.io/) for implementation details.
