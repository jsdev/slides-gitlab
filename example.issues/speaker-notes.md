## Summary

Add support for speaker notes in markdown slides.

## Motivation

Speaker notes help presenters remember key points and add context that isn't shown to the audience.

## Proposed Solution

Allow users to add notes to each slide using a markdown extension (e.g., `:::notes ... :::`). Display notes in a presenter view.

## Alternatives Considered

- Separate notes file per deck
- Inline comments in markdown

## Additional Context

Many presentation tools offer speaker notes for presenters.
