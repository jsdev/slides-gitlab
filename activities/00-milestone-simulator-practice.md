# Activity 0: GitLab Milestone Simulator Practice

## üéØ **Objective**
Learn GitLab milestone creation fundamentals using an interactive simulator that doesn't require access to a real GitLab environment. Perfect for training scenarios with limited GitLab access.

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è **Duration**: 15 minutes
- **Simulator Practice**: 12 minutes
- **Reflection & Discussion**: 3 minutes

---

## üìã **Prerequisites**
- Web browser access to the training platform
- Basic understanding of project management concepts
- No GitLab account or repository access required

---

## üöÄ **Your Mission**

Complete all four steps in the GitLab Milestone Simulator to practice creating realistic sprint milestones with proper capacity planning and issue management.

### **Why Use the Simulator?**
The simulator provides a safe, risk-free environment to:
- Practice GitLab workflows without affecting real projects
- Learn through trial and error without consequences
- Understand milestone concepts before accessing real GitLab
- Train when GitLab environments aren't available

## üìù **Step-by-Step Instructions**

### **Step 1: Access the Simulator** (1 minute)
1. Navigate to the **Interactive Exercises** section
2. Click on **"GitLab Milestone Creation Simulator"**
3. Read the introduction and click **"Start Milestone Simulator"**

### **Step 2: Complete Simulator Steps** (10 minutes)

#### **Simulator Step 1: Create Milestone** (2 minutes)
- **Practice**: Use proper naming convention: `Sprint [Number] - [Theme] - [Dates]`
- **Example**: `Sprint 13 - Platform Enhancement - July 21 - Aug 4, 2025`
- **Focus**: Write a clear, concise description explaining the sprint goal
- **Validation**: Check that all required fields are completed

#### **Simulator Step 2: Calculate Capacity** (3 minutes)
- **Practice**: Adjust team parameters to see how they affect capacity
- **Experiment**: Try different team sizes (3-8 people)
- **Learn**: See how availability percentage impacts total capacity
- **Formula**: Team Size √ó Sprint Days √ó Availability % √ó Velocity = Capacity

#### **Simulator Step 3: Add Issues** (3 minutes)
- **Practice**: Select issues that fit within your calculated capacity
- **Balance**: Mix different story point sizes and priorities
- **Strategy**: Aim for 60-80% capacity utilization
- **Observe**: Watch how issue selection affects total commitment

#### **Simulator Step 4: Validate Sprint** (2 minutes)
- **Review**: Check all health indicators are green
- **Adjust**: Make changes if validation shows problems
- **Complete**: Finalize your milestone when all checks pass

### **Step 3: Review Results** (2 minutes)
- **Achievements**: See what milestone planning skills you've demonstrated
- **Summary**: Review your final milestone configuration
- **Metrics**: Understand your capacity utilization and story point allocation

### **Step 4: Reflection** (2 minutes)
- **Compare**: How does this relate to real project planning?
- **Apply**: What would you do differently in a real GitLab environment?
- **Prepare**: What questions do you have about actual GitLab milestone features?

## ü§ñ **Leverage Learning with Questions**

**During Simulator Practice:**
- "What happens if I exceed team capacity?"
- "How does changing availability percentage affect planning?"
- "What's a good balance of story point sizes?"
- "How should I handle high vs. medium priority work?"

**For Real-World Application:**
- "How would I create this same milestone in actual GitLab?"
- "What GitLab features aren't represented in the simulator?"
- "How do I handle dependencies between issues in real projects?"
- "What reports can GitLab generate from milestone data?"
