## High Vulnerabilities (CVSS 7.0-8.9)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **High Priority** (24-hour SLA)
- Review and assess impact
- Plan remediation within next sprint
- Document risk acceptance if immediate fix not possible

## Medium Vulnerabilities (CVSS 4.0-6.9)
- üìã **Standard Priority** (7-day SLA)
- Include in regular development cycle
- Group with related security improvements
- Update dependencies during regular maintenance

## Low/Info Vulnerabilities (CVSS 0.1-3.9)

            if file.endswith('.py') or file.endswith('.js'):
                with open(os.path.join(root, file), 'r') as f:
                    content = f.read()
                    for pattern in pii_patterns:
                        if re.search(pattern, content, re.IGNORECASE):
                            violations.append(f"Potential GDPR violation in {file}")
    
    return violations

def check_consent_mechanisms():
    """Verify consent collection mechanisms"""
    # Implementation for checking consent flows
    pass

def generate_compliance_report():
    violations = check_personal_data_handling()
