## 🎯 **Objective**
Establish seamless collaboration workflows between design and development teams using GitLab's design management features, version control for design assets, and integrated review processes for enhanced creative-technical alignment.

---

## ⏱️ **Duration**: 20 minutes
- **Design Asset Management Setup**: 8 minutes
- **Review Workflow Implementation**: 7 minutes
- **Integration Points Configuration**: 5 minutes

---

## 📋 **Prerequisites**
- Completed Activity 3.4 (Advanced Git Workflow Implementation)
- Understanding of design-to-development handoff challenges
- Access to design files (Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD, or similar)
- Basic knowledge of GitLab's design management features

---

## 🚀 **Your Mission**

Create a professional design-development integration workflow that eliminates handoff friction, maintains design consistency, and enables real-time collaboration between creative and technical teams using GitLab's integrated platform.

### **Training Platform Context**
The slides-gitlab training platform uses integrated design-development workflows to maintain consistent visual design across slides, web interfaces, and documentation. You'll practice the same collaborative processes used to keep this platform's design system coherent.

## 🎨 **Part 1: Design Asset Management Setup** (8 minutes)

### **Repository Structure for Design Assets:**

#### **Create Design Organization Structure:**
```
slides-gitlab/
├── design/
│   ├── design-system/
│   │   ├── colors.md
│   │   ├── typography.md
│   │   ├── components.md
│   │   └── spacing.md
│   ├── wireframes/
│   │   ├── user-flows/
│   │   └── page-layouts/
│   ├── visual-design/
│   │   ├── high-fidelity/
│   │   └── prototypes/
│   └── assets/
│       ├── icons/
│       ├── images/
│       └── brand-elements/
```

#### **Design File Management Best Practices:**

**1. Version Control for Design Files:**
```bash
# Track design file changes with meaningful commits
git add design/visual-design/homepage-redesign-v2.fig
git commit -m "design: update homepage layout for mobile responsiveness

- Adjust grid system for better mobile experience
- Update CTA button positioning and sizing
- Refine color contrast for accessibility compliance
- Add breakpoint specifications for development handoff

Related issue: #456"
```

**2. Design Documentation Standards:**
```markdown
# Component Design Specification

## Button Component v2.1

### Visual Properties
- Primary color: #3B82F6 (blue-500)
- Border radius: 8px

**2. Design Discussion Threads:**
```
💬 Design Discussion Thread

@frontend-dev: "The new card layout looks great! Quick question about the 
hover animation - should this be a simple scale transform or do you envision 
something more complex?"

@ux-designer: "Good catch! I was thinking simple scale (1.02) with a subtle 
shadow increase. Let me add animation specs to the design system doc."

@accessibility-expert: "Reminder to test focus states for keyboard navigation. 
The current design doesn't show clear focus indicators."

@ux-designer: "Absolutely! Adding focus state designs to the component spec now."
```

## 🎯 **Advanced Integration Patterns**

### **Design System as Code:**
```css
/* CSS Custom Properties from Design System */
:root {
  /* Colors from design tokens */
  --color-primary: #3B82F6;
  --color-primary-hover: #2563EB;
  
  /* Typography from design system */
  --font-size-heading-1: 2.25rem;
  --font-weight-heading: 600;
  
  /* Spacing system */
  --spacing-xs: 0.25rem;
  --spacing-sm: 0.5rem;
  --spacing-md: 1rem;
}

/* Component following design specifications */
.button-primary {
  background-color: var(--color-primary);
  font-size: var(--font-size-button);
  padding: var(--spacing-sm) var(--spacing-md);
  transition: background-color 200ms ease;
}

.button-primary:hover {
  background-color: var(--color-primary-hover);
}
```

### **Design Token Integration:**

{
  "design-tokens": {
    "colors": {
      "primary": {
        "50": "#EFF6FF",
        "500": "#3B82F6",
        "900": "#1E3A8A"
      }
    },

      "heading-1": {
        "fontSize": "36px",
        "lineHeight": "40px",
        "fontWeight": 600
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### **Automated Design QA:**
```yaml
# Design QA Pipeline
design_qa:
  stage: test
  script:
    - npm run design-token-validation
    - npm run accessibility-audit
    - npm run visual-regression-test
  artifacts:
