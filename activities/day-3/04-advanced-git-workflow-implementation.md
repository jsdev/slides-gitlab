# Activity 3.4: Advanced Git Workflow Implementation

## üéØ **Objective**
Master advanced Git branching strategies, merge request workflows, and conflict resolution using GitLab's interface while implementing professional development practices for complex project scenarios.

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è **Duration**: 35 minutes
- **Branching Strategy Setup**: 10 minutes
- **Merge Request Workflow**: 15 minutes
- **Conflict Resolution Practice**: 10 minutes

---

## üìã **Prerequisites**
- Completed Activity 3.1 (Branch Naming Challenge)
- Completed Activity 3.2 (Create First CI/CD Pipeline)
- Access to slides-gitlab repository with Developer permissions
- Understanding of basic Git operations (clone, add, commit, push)

---

## üöÄ **Your Mission**

Implement a complete advanced Git workflow using GitLab's merge request system, practicing branch protection rules, review processes, and conflict resolution that mirrors professional development environments.

### **Training Platform Context**
The slides-gitlab platform uses sophisticated Git workflows to manage contributions from multiple trainers, content updates, and feature development. You'll practice the same workflows used to maintain this training platform.

## üìù **Step-by-Step Instructions**

### **Step 1: Set Up Advanced Branching Strategy** (10 minutes)

#### **Create Feature Branch Structure:**
1. **Navigate to Repository**:
   - Go to slides-gitlab project
   - Click **Repository** ‚Üí **Branches**
   - Observe existing branch structure

2. **Create Feature Branch**:
   ```bash
   # From your local clone or GitLab Web IDE
   git checkout -b feature/advanced-workflow-practice
   ```

3. **Understand Branch Protection**:
   - Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Repository** ‚Üí **Push Rules**
   - Note: main branch should be protected
   - Review merge request requirements

#### **Practice Professional Naming**:
Create branches following enterprise conventions:
- `feature/activity-enhancement-#{issue-number}`
- `bugfix/markdown-rendering-#{issue-number}`
- `hotfix/security-patch-#{issue-number}`

### **Step 2: Implement Merge Request Workflow** (15 minutes)

#### **Create Meaningful Changes**:
1. **Modify Training Content**:
   - Edit a slide file or create new activity documentation
   - Make changes that demonstrate learning (e.g., add notes, fix typos)
   - Ensure changes are substantial enough for review

2. **Commit with Professional Messages**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: enhance activity instructions for clarity
   
   - Add step-by-step numbering for better flow
   - Include troubleshooting section for common issues
   - Improve prerequisite documentation
   
   Closes #[issue-number] (if applicable)"
   ```

#### **Create Comprehensive Merge Request**:
1. **Push and Create MR**:
   - Push your feature branch
   - Navigate to **Merge Requests** ‚Üí **New merge request**

2. **Write Professional MR Description**:
   ```markdown
   ## What does this MR do?
   Enhances activity instructions for improved clarity and user experience.

   ## Why was this change made?
   Current instructions lack clarity in steps 3-5, causing confusion during training sessions.

   ## Testing performed
   - Reviewed instructions with test user
   - Verified all links work correctly
   - Confirmed markdown renders properly

   ## Related issues
   Closes #123 (if applicable)

   ## Screenshots (if applicable)
   [Add before/after screenshots if relevant]
   ```

3. **Configure MR Settings**:
   - Assign reviewer (instructor or peer)
   - Add appropriate labels (enhancement, documentation, etc.)
   - Set milestone if applicable
   - Enable "Delete source branch when merge request is accepted"

### **Step 3: Conflict Resolution Practice** (10 minutes)

#### **Create Intentional Conflict**:
1. **Simulate Concurrent Development**:
   - Work with a partner or create second branch
   - Both modify the same lines in a file
   - Create merge conflict scenario

2. **Resolve Using GitLab Interface**:
   - Navigate to the conflicted merge request
   - Use GitLab's **Web IDE** conflict resolution
   - Review conflict markers:
     ```
     <<<<<<< HEAD
     Original content
     =======
     Your changes
     >>>>>>> feature/your-branch
     ```

3. **Professional Resolution Process**:
   - Analyze both changes for intent
   - Combine the best of both approaches
   - Test the resolved version
   - Document resolution reasoning in commit message
