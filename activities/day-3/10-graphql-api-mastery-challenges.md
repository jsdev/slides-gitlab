## üìù **Challenge Series**

### **üèÅ Challenge 1: Project Discovery (3 minutes)**

**Goal**: Get basic project information and understand GraphQL structure.

**Your Task**: Write a query to fetch:
- Project name and description
- Project ID and web URL
- Default branch name
- Star count and fork count

**Hints**:
- Start with the `project` root field
- Use `fullPath` parameter: `"gitlab-org/gitlab"` or your chosen project
- Explore the right panel to discover available fields
- üí° **Duo Chat Prompt**: "How do I query basic project information using GitLab GraphQL API?"

**Success Criteria**: You should get a JSON response with project metadata.

---

### **üîç Challenge 2: Issue Investigation (4 minutes)**

**Goal**: Query issues with specific filters and understand pagination.

**Your Task**: Write a query to find:
- First 10 open issues
- Issue title, description (first 100 characters), and web URL
- Author information (name and username)
- Created date and updated date
- Label names

**Hints**:
- Use `issues` field within the project
- Apply `state: opened` filter
- Use `first: 10` for pagination
- Truncate description with `description(limit: 100)`
- üí° **Duo Chat Prompt**: "Show me how to query GitLab issues with author details and labels using GraphQL"

**Bonus**: Try filtering by specific labels or date ranges.

---

### **üîÄ Challenge 3: Merge Request Analysis (5 minutes)**

**Goal**: Understand complex nested queries and merge request workflows.

**Your Task**: Write a query to fetch:
- Last 5 merge requests (any state)
- Title, description, source branch, target branch
- Author and assignee information
- Approval status and merge status
- Pipeline status (if available)
- Number of upvotes and downvotes

**Hints**:
- Use `mergeRequests` field with `last: 5`
- Nested fields: `author { name username }`, `assignees { nodes { name } }`
- Pipeline info: `headPipeline { status }`
- üí° **Duo Chat Prompt**: "Help me write a GraphQL query for GitLab merge requests with pipeline and approval details"

**Bonus**: Filter for merge requests from a specific author or with specific approval status.

---

### **‚öôÔ∏è Challenge 4: Pipeline Deep Dive (4 minutes)**

**Goal**: Navigate complex data relationships and understand CI/CD through GraphQL.

**Your Task**: Write a query to fetch:
- Last 3 pipelines from the default branch
- Pipeline status, duration, and created date
- Associated commit information (SHA, message, author)
- Job details: name, status, stage, and duration
- Total job count per pipeline

**Hints**:
- Use `pipelines` field with `ref: "main"` (or your default branch)
- Jobs are nested: `jobs { nodes { name status stage duration } }`
- Commit info: `commit { sha shortSha message author { name } }`
- üí° **Duo Chat Prompt**: "Show me how to query GitLab CI/CD pipeline details including jobs and commit info via GraphQL"

**Bonus**: Calculate total pipeline duration by summing job durations.

---

### **üéØ Challenge 5: Advanced Query Optimization (6 minutes)**

**Goal**: Master query optimization, aliases, and fragments for efficient data fetching.

**Your Task**: Create an optimized query that fetches:
- Project statistics (using aliases for clarity)
- Recent activity summary (issues, MRs, pipelines from last 7 days)
- Top contributors (based on recent commits)
- Repository file tree (specific directory)

**Hints**:
- Use aliases: `openIssues: issues(state: opened)` vs `closedIssues: issues(state: closed)`
- Date filtering: `createdAfter: "2024-01-20T00:00:00Z"`
- Fragments for reusable author info: `fragment AuthorInfo on User { name username avatarUrl }`
- Repository queries: `repository { tree { nodes { name type } } }`
- üí° **Duo Chat Prompt**: "Help me optimize a complex GitLab GraphQL query using aliases and fragments for project analytics"

**Success Criteria**: Single query that provides a comprehensive project dashboard view.

---

### **üöÄ Challenge 6: Custom Analytics Query (8 minutes)**

**Goal**: Build a practical analytics query that could power real automation or reporting.

**Your Task**: Design a query for one of these scenarios:

**Option A: Release Planning Dashboard**
- Upcoming milestones with progress
- Issues by milestone and priority
- Merge request velocity metrics
- Blocker identification

**Option B: Team Productivity Report**
- Contributor activity over time
- Code review participation
- Issue resolution patterns
- Sprint/milestone completion rates

**Option C: Quality Metrics Analysis**
- Pipeline success rates over time
- Test coverage trends
- Security vulnerability tracking
- Code quality evolution

**Hints**:
- Combine multiple root queries or use nested aggregations
- Use date ranges for trend analysis
- Leverage GitLab's built-in analytics fields
- üí° **Duo Chat Prompt**: "Help me create a comprehensive GitLab analytics query for [your chosen scenario] using GraphQL"

**Bonus**: Export results and create a simple visualization or report.

## üß≠ **Navigation Tips**

### **Understanding GraphQL Schema**
- **Right Panel**: Browse available fields and types
- **Ctrl+Space**: Auto-complete in query editor
- **Documentation**: Click on field names for detailed descriptions
- **Type System**: Understand scalars, objects, lists, and non-null fields

### **Query Structure Best Practices**
```graphql
query ProjectAnalysis($projectPath: ID!) {
  project(fullPath: $projectPath) {
    # Always request ID for caching
    id
    name
    description
    
    # Use fragments for repeated structures
    ...ProjectStats
    
    # Paginate large datasets
    issues(first: 10, state: opened) {
      nodes {
        id
        title
        author {
          ...UserInfo
        }
      }
      pageInfo {
        hasNextPage
        endCursor
      }
    }
  }
}

fragment ProjectStats on Project {
  starCount
  forkCount
  issuesEnabled
  mergeRequestsEnabled
}

fragment UserInfo on User {
  id
  name
  username
  avatarUrl
}
```

### **Common Pitfalls to Avoid**
- **Over-fetching**: Only request fields you need
- **Deep nesting**: Limit query depth to avoid timeouts
- **No pagination**: Always paginate lists to avoid large responses
- **Missing error handling**: Check for GraphQL errors in responses
