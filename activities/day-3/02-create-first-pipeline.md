# Activity 3.2: Create Your First CI/CD Pipeline

## üéØ **Objective**
Build your first GitLab CI/CD pipeline from scratch, learning the fundamental concepts of stages, jobs, and automated workflows while creating a functional two-stage pipeline that demonstrates build and test automation.

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è **Duration**: 30 minutes
- **Pipeline Editor Setup**: 5 minutes
- **Stages Definition**: 5 minutes
- **Build Job Creation**: 10 minutes
- **Test Job Creation**: 5 minutes
- **Commit & Execution**: 5 minutes

---

## üìã **Prerequisites**
- Completed Activity 3.1 (Branch Naming Challenge)
- Access to slides-gitlab repository with Developer permissions
- Basic understanding of YAML syntax (will be explained)
- Familiarity with GitLab navigation

---

## üöÄ **Your Mission**

Create a complete CI/CD pipeline with build and test stages using GitLab's Pipeline Editor, demonstrating how automated workflows can streamline development processes for training platform projects.

### **Training Platform Context**
The slides-gitlab platform benefits from CI/CD automation to ensure code quality, run tests, and deploy updates reliably. Your pipeline will simulate typical development workflows used in professional training platform maintenance.

---

## üìù **Step-by-Step Instructions**

### **Step 1: Open the Pipeline Editor** (5 minutes)

#### **Navigate to CI/CD Editor:**
1. In the slides-gitlab repository, go to the **left sidebar**
2. Find and click **CI/CD** ‚Üí **Editor**
3. This opens GitLab's recommended tool for creating `.gitlab-ci.yml` files

#### **Prepare for Fresh Start:**
- If you see an existing file, **select all content** and **delete it**
- We'll start with a clean slate to understand each component

#### **Why Pipeline Editor?**
- **Syntax validation** as you type
- **Helpful tooltips** and documentation
- **Live preview** of pipeline structure
- **Error detection** before committing

---

### **Step 2: Define Your Stages** (5 minutes)

#### **Understanding Stages:**
Stages define the **overall order of execution** in your pipeline. Jobs in earlier stages must complete successfully before later stages begin.

#### **Add Stages Configuration:**
Type this at the **top of your file**:

```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test
```

#### **What This Means:**
- **`build` stage**: Contains jobs that compile, package, or prepare code
- **`test` stage**: Contains jobs that validate, test, or verify the build
- **Sequential execution**: All `build` jobs complete before any `test` jobs start
- **Professional workflow**: Mirrors real development pipelines

---

### **Step 3: Create the Build Job** (10 minutes)

#### **Understanding Jobs:**
A job is a **set of commands executed by a GitLab Runner**. Each job runs in an isolated environment and performs specific tasks.

#### **Add Build Job Configuration:**
Add this code **below your stages**:

```yaml
build_project:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "This is the build job."
    - echo "Compiling training platform code..."
    - echo "Installing dependencies..."
    - sleep 10
    - echo "Build complete - artifacts ready for testing."
  artifacts:
    reports:
      junit: "test-results.xml"
    expire_in: 1 hour
```

#### **Component Breakdown:**

**Job Definition:**
- **`build_project`**: Custom job name (descriptive and meaningful)
- **`stage: build`**: Assigns this job to the build stage
- **`script:`**: Contains shell commands executed sequentially

**Script Commands:**
- **`echo` statements**: Provide clear feedback about progress
- **`sleep 10`**: Simulates realistic build time
- **Descriptive messages**: Help track pipeline progress

**Advanced Features:**
- **`artifacts:`**: Preserves build outputs for later stages
- **`expire_in:`**: Automatically cleans up old artifacts

---

### **Step 4: Create the Test Job** (5 minutes)

#### **Add Test Job Configuration:**
Add this code at the **bottom of your file**:

```yaml
run_tests:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "This is the test job."
    - echo "Running unit tests for slides-gitlab..."
    - echo "Testing markdown parsing..."
    - echo "Validating slide generation..."
    - sleep 5
    - echo "All tests passed - no errors found."
  dependencies:
    - build_project
```

#### **Test Job Features:**

**Structure:**
- **`run_tests`**: Clear, descriptive job name
- **`stage: test`**: Executes after build stage completes
- **Training-specific tests**: Reflects actual platform testing needs

**Dependencies:**
- **`dependencies:`**: Explicitly links to build job artifacts
- **Sequential logic**: Tests use outputs from build stage

---

### **Step 5: Complete Pipeline Review** (2 minutes)

#### **Your Complete `.gitlab-ci.yml` File:**

```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test

build_project:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "This is the build job."
    - echo "Compiling training platform code..."
    - echo "Installing dependencies..."
    - sleep 10
    - echo "Build complete - artifacts ready for testing."
  artifacts:
    reports:
      junit: "test-results.xml"
    expire_in: 1 hour

run_tests:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "This is the test job."
    - echo "Running unit tests for slides-gitlab..."
    - echo "Testing markdown parsing..."
    - echo "Validating slide generation..."
    - sleep 5
    - echo "All tests passed - no errors found."
  dependencies:
    - build_project
```

#### **Validation Checklist:**
- [ ] Two stages defined: `build` and `test`
- [ ] Build job assigned to build stage
- [ ] Test job assigned to test stage
- [ ] All script commands are meaningful
- [ ] Dependencies properly configured

---

### **Step 6: Commit and Watch it Run!** (3 minutes)

#### **Commit Your Pipeline:**
1. **Scroll to bottom** of the Pipeline Editor
2. **Add commit message**: `"Add initial CI/CD pipeline with build and test stages"`
3. **Click "Commit changes"**

#### **Watch Pipeline Execution:**
1. **Navigate to** CI/CD ‚Üí **Pipelines** in left sidebar
2. **Find your new pipeline** at the top (status: 'running')
3. **Click on the pipeline** to watch real-time execution
4. **Observe job progression**: Build completes, then test begins

#### **Celebrate Success! üéâ**
You've just created a **fully functional, automated CI/CD pipeline**!

## üèÜ **Bonus Challenges**

### **Challenge 1: Add a Deployment Stage**
Add a third stage that simulates deployment:

```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

deploy_to_staging:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "Deploying slides-gitlab to staging environment..."
    - echo "Running deployment scripts..."
    - sleep 3
    - echo "Deployment complete - staging environment updated."
  only:
    - main
```

### **Challenge 2: Environment Variables**
Add environment configuration to your build job:

```yaml
build_project:
  stage: build
  variables:
    BUILD_ENV: "production"
    NODE_VERSION: "18"
  script:
    - echo "Building for environment: $BUILD_ENV"
    - echo "Using Node.js version: $NODE_VERSION"
    # ... rest of build script
```

### **Challenge 3: Conditional Execution**
Add a job that only runs on specific branches:

```yaml
security_scan:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "Running security vulnerability scan..."
    - echo "Checking for dependency vulnerabilities..."
    - echo "Security scan complete."
  only:
    - merge_requests
    - main
```
