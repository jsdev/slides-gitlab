```

**Priority Score (1-10): _____ | Implementation Effort (1-10): _____**

**C. Deployment and Monitoring (High value - 2-5 days setup)**
```
CI/CD Pipeline Integration:
├── GitLab CI → Cloud deployment platforms
├── GitLab Pipeline → Monitoring dashboards
├── GitLab Releases → Customer notification systems
└── GitLab Environments → Infrastructure management
```

**Priority Score (1-10): _____ | Implementation Effort (1-10): _____**

**D. Advanced Business Intelligence (Strategic - 1-2 weeks)**
```
Data Flow Architecture:
├── GitLab Analytics → Business dashboards
├── GitLab Time Data → Resource planning tools
├── GitLab Velocity → Capacity planning systems
└── GitLab Security Scans → Compliance reporting
```

**Priority Score (1-10): _____ | Implementation Effort (1-10): _____**
