# Activity 3.1: The Branch Naming Challenge

## üéØ **Objective**
Master Git branch naming conventions using real issues from the slides-gitlab repository, developing skills to create descriptive, traceable branch names that enhance team collaboration and project organization.

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è **Duration**: 25 minutes
- **Convention Introduction**: 5 minutes
- **Interactive Challenge**: 15 minutes
- **Group Discussion & Best Practices**: 5 minutes

---

## üìã **Prerequisites**
- Basic Git knowledge (creating and switching branches)
- Completed Day 1 and Day 2 activities
- Access to slides-gitlab repository
- Understanding of issue types and labels

---

## üöÄ **Your Mission**

You'll practice creating professional branch names using actual issues from our slides-gitlab repository, applying industry-standard conventions that make repository navigation and team collaboration seamless.

## üéØ **Part 1: The Importance of Naming Conventions** (5 minutes)

### **Why Branch Names Matter**

A well-named branch gives you context at a glance. When you see a branch named `#23-fix-markdown-injection`, you immediately understand:
- **Issue traceability**: Links to issue #23
- **Work type**: It's a bug fix
- **What's being addressed**: Markdown injection vulnerability

### **Our Training Platform Convention**

For this activity, we'll use a simple, professional convention:

```
[issue-number]-[work-type]-[short-description]
```

**Work Types:**
- `fix` - Bug fixes and security patches
- `feat` - New features and enhancements  
- `chore` - Maintenance, refactoring, tooling
- `perf` - Performance improvements
- `docs` - Documentation updates

**Naming Best Practices:**
- Use lowercase and hyphens (kebab-case)
- Keep descriptions concise but meaningful
- Include issue number for traceability
- Be consistent across the team

## üé≤ **Part 2: Interactive Challenge - Name That Branch!** (15 minutes)

### **Instructions:**
1. **Form small groups** (2-3 people) or work individually
2. **Review each scenario** from our actual repository issues
3. **Create appropriate branch names** using our convention
4. **Discuss your reasoning** with teammates
5. **Be ready to share** your branch name and rationale

---

### **üîê Scenario 1: Security Fix** (5 minutes)

**Real Issue from `/example/issues/security/markdown-injection.md`:**

```
Summary: The markdown parser does not sanitize input, allowing script injection via markdown files.

Impact: Attackers could craft malicious markdown that executes JavaScript in viewers' browsers.

Mitigation: Sanitize markdown input before rendering, using libraries like DOMPurify.
```

**Your Challenge:**
Create a branch name for fixing this security vulnerability.

**Consider:**
- This is a security fix (what work type?)
- It's about markdown injection
- It affects the parser/rendering system

<details>
<summary>üí° Example Answer (click to reveal)</summary>

**Good Options:**
- `#45-fix-markdown-injection`
- `#45-fix-script-injection`
- `#45-fix-markdown-sanitization`

**Best Choice:** `#45-fix-markdown-injection`
- Clear issue type (fix)
- Specific problem (markdown injection)
- Professional and searchable
</details>

---

### **‚ôø Scenario 2: Accessibility Enhancement** (5 minutes)

**Real Issue from `/example/issues/feature-requests/accessibility-heading-order.md`:**

```
Summary: Improve accessibility by ensuring heading elements in slides are rendered in a sequentially-descending order, while preserving the original markdown creator's intent and style.

Motivation: Screen readers and accessibility tools expect headings to follow a logical order (e.g., h1 > h2 > h3).

Solution: Automatically adjust heading levels to maintain sequential order while preserving styling.
```

**Your Challenge:**
Create a branch name for implementing this accessibility feature.

**Consider:**
- This is a new feature enhancement
- It's specifically about accessibility
- It involves heading order/structure

<details>
<summary>üí° Example Answer (click to reveal)</summary>

**Good Options:**
- `#78-feat-accessibility-headings`
- `#78-feat-heading-order`
- `#78-feat-sequential-headings`

**Best Choice:** `#78-feat-accessibility-headings`
- Clear feature type (feat)
- Indicates accessibility focus
- Specific to headings
</details>

---

### **üîß Scenario 3: Development Tooling** (5 minutes)

**Real Issue from `/example/issues/chore/add-eslint-rule.md`:**

```
Task Description: Add a specific ESLint rule to enforce consistent use of arrow functions for component definitions.

Motivation: Consistent function style improves readability and maintainability across the codebase.

Acceptance Criteria: ESLint rule is added to config, all component definitions use arrow functions, linting passes without errors.
```

**Your Challenge:**
Create a branch name for adding this ESLint rule.

**Consider:**
- This is maintenance/tooling work
- It's about adding a linting rule
- It affects code style/consistency

<details>
<summary>üí° Example Answer (click to reveal)</summary>

**Good Options:**
- `#102-chore-eslint-arrow-functions`
- `#102-chore-add-eslint-rule`
- `#102-chore-arrow-function-rule`

**Best Choice:** `#102-chore-eslint-arrow-functions`
- Clear chore type (tooling)
- Specific tool (eslint)
- Clear purpose (arrow functions)
</details>

## üèÜ **Bonus Challenge: Advanced Scenarios**

### **Performance Issue** (Optional)
From `/example/issues/performance/svg-image-optimization.md`:
"Optimize SVG usage by preferring `<img src="...">` for SVGs instead of inline SVG"

**Branch Name Ideas:**
- `#67-perf-svg-optimization`
- `#67-perf-svg-image-tags`

### **Refactoring Task** (Optional)
From `/example/issues/refactor/modularize-components.md`:
"Break down large components into smaller, reusable modules"
