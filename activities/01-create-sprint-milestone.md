### **Step 4: Add Issues to Milestone** (5 minutes)
Look for existing issues in the repository or create these sample issues:

**Suggested Issues for slides-gitlab:**
1. **"Update GitLab CI/CD slides with latest features"** (8 story points)
   - Priority: High
   - Assignee: [Your name]
   
2. **"Add interactive exercise for merge request workflows"** (5 story points)
   - Priority: Medium
   - Assignee: Team member
   
3. **"Fix responsive design issues in slide viewer"** (3 story points)
   - Priority: High
   - Assignee: Frontend developer
   
4. **"Create assessment quiz for advanced Git workflows"** (8 story points)
   - Priority: Medium
   - Assignee: Content creator

**To assign issues:**
1. Go to each issue
2. Click **"Edit"**
3. Select your milestone from the dropdown
4. Add appropriate labels and assignees

### **Step 5: Validate Your Sprint** (2 minutes)
Check your sprint setup:
- [ ] Total story points ‚â§ team capacity
- [ ] Mix of high and medium priority items
- [ ] Clear sprint goal that adds business value
- [ ] Realistic due dates
- [ ] All team members have work assigned

## ü§î **Guiding Questions**

**Before You Start:**
- What's your team's realistic availability percentage?
- How many story points does your team typically complete?
- What external dependencies might affect this sprint?

**During Planning:**
- What would make this sprint successful beyond just completing stories?
- How does this sprint align with longer-term product goals?
- What risks could derail this sprint, and how can we mitigate them?

**For Capacity Planning:**
- Are you accounting for code reviews, meetings, and documentation time?
- Do you have a good mix of story point sizes?
- Is there enough work for everyone, but not too much?
