## üõ†Ô∏è **Training Environment Setup**

These activities are designed to work with the `slides-gitlab` repository, but can be adapted for any GitLab project:

**Recommended Setup:**
- GitLab repository with Issues enabled
- Milestone and Issue Board access
- Basic labeling system in place
- Team members with appropriate permissions

**üö® No GitLab Access? No Problem!**
If trainees don't have access to a GitLab environment, they can use our **[Interactive Milestone Simulator](../app/exercises/GitLabMilestoneSimulator.tsx)** to practice the same skills in a web-based environment that mimics GitLab's interface.

**Adaptation Tips:**
- Replace repository-specific examples with your project context
- Adjust team sizes and capacity calculations for your organization
- Modify issue examples to match your domain and priorities

## üí° **Training Tips**

**For Maximum Learning:**
- **Practice in pairs** or small teams when possible
- **Use real scenarios** from your actual work context
- **Make mistakes** and learn from them in a safe environment
- **Document insights** and share with your team
- **Iterate and improve** your processes based on experience

**Common Challenges:**
- **Permissions**: Ensure appropriate GitLab access levels
- **Context**: Adapt examples to your specific project needs
- **Time Management**: Some activities may take longer for first-time users
- **Integration**: Connect learnings to your actual workflow processes

**ü§ñ GitLab Duo Chat Best Practices:**

### **Effective Prompting Strategies:**
- **Be Specific**: Include context about your team size, project type, and goals
- **Ask Follow-ups**: Build on Duo Chat responses with deeper questions
- **Request Examples**: Ask for specific templates, examples, or scenarios
- **Validate Ideas**: Use Duo Chat to review and improve your work

### **Sample Prompt Patterns:**
```
"I'm working on [specific activity] for a [team type] of [size]. Help me [specific request]."

"Review this [GitLab artifact] and suggest improvements: [paste your work]"

"What are common mistakes when [specific GitLab task] and how can I avoid them?"

"Generate [number] examples of [GitLab concept] for a [project context]"
```

### **Learning Amplification:**
- **Compare Approaches**: Ask Duo Chat to show multiple ways to solve the same problem
- **Explore Alternatives**: "What other options do I have for [GitLab feature]?"
- **Best Practices**: "What are industry best practices for [GitLab workflow]?"
- **Troubleshooting**: "What could go wrong with this approach and how do I prevent it?"
