**Use Case**: Sprint planning, user experience prioritization

#### **Search 3: Quick Wins for Sprint Planning**
```
label:effort::small state:opened assignee:none
```
**Purpose**: Find small, unassigned tasks perfect for sprint fillers
**Save As**: "Quick Wins Available"
**Use Case**: Sprint capacity optimization, new team member assignments

#### **Search 4: Trainer Tools Ready for Review**
```
label:ux::trainer label:status::review
```
**Purpose**: Find trainer-focused features awaiting review
**Save As**: "Trainer Tools - Review Needed"
**Use Case**: Code review prioritization, trainer stakeholder updates

#### **Search 5: UI Component Work Backlog**
```
label:component::ui state:opened sort:priority-desc
```
**Purpose**: All user interface work sorted by priority
**Save As**: "UI Development Pipeline"
**Use Case**: Frontend development planning, design coordination

### **Step 3: Create Advanced Workflow Searches** (4 minutes)

#### **Search 6: Overdue Training Platform Work**
```
assignee:@me due_date:overdue state:opened
```
**Purpose**: Identify delayed work requiring immediate attention
**Save As**: "My Overdue Work"
**Use Case**: Daily priority assessment, deadline management

```
label:component::performance label:priority::high OR label:priority::critical
```
**Purpose**: Critical platform performance work
**Save As**: "Performance Critical"
**Use Case**: Site reliability focus, technical debt management

#### **Search 9: Unestimated Training Features**
```
weight:none state:opened label:ux::learner OR label:ux::trainer
```
**Purpose**: Training features missing time estimates
**Save As**: "Needs Estimation"
**Use Case**: Sprint planning preparation, estimation sessions

### **Step 4: Implement Label Subscriptions** (1 minute)

#### **Subscribe to Key Labels:**
1. Navigate to **Issues** → **Labels**
2. Find and click on high-value labels for your role:
   - **For All Roles**: `priority::critical` (immediate awareness of critical issues)
   - **For Trainers**: `ux::trainer` (trainer tool developments)
   - **For Developers**: `component::ui` or `component::performance` (technical focus areas)
   - **For Content Creators**: `ux::creator` (content workflow improvements)

#### **Set Up Notifications:**
3. Click **Subscribe** on 2-3 most relevant labels
4. Configure notification preferences for label updates
5. Consider subscribing to `status::review` if you participate in code reviews

### **Step 5: Test and Refine Your Searches** (1 minute)

#### **Validate Each Search:**
1. Run each saved search to ensure it returns expected results
2. Verify searches use the labels you created in Activity 1.4
3. Test that searches return issues from your Activities 1.2 and 1.3 work
4. Adjust search parameters if needed for optimal results

#### **Quick Validation Questions:**
- **Does "My Current Work" show your assigned issues?**
- **Does "Quick Wins Available" show small, unassigned tasks?**
- **Does "Critical Learner Issues" prioritize user experience properly?**
