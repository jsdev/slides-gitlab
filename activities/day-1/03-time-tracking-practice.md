## üìù **Step-by-Step Instructions**

### **Step 1: Navigate to Your Existing Issue** (2 minutes)

#### **Locate Your Previous Work:**
1. Go to **Issues** ‚Üí **List**
2. Find the advanced issue you created in Activity 1.2
3. Click to open the issue detail view
4. Scroll down to the comment section where you'll add time tracking commands

#### **Quick Review:**
- Notice the **Time tracking** section in the right sidebar (may show "No estimate or time spent")
- This is where your time data will appear as you add it

### **Step 2: Add Initial Time Estimates** (4 minutes)

#### **Practice Basic Estimation:**
Add a comment with the `/estimate` quick action:

**For Small Enhancements (like UI improvements):**
```
/estimate 2h
```

**For Medium Features (like progress tracking):**
```
/estimate 1d 2h
```

**For Larger Features (like new training modules):**
```
/estimate 3d
```

#### **Choose Your Estimate:**
Based on your issue's complexity:
- **UI/UX Changes**: 2-6 hours (`2h` to `6h`)
- **New Features**: 1-3 days (`1d` to `3d`)
- **Platform Improvements**: 4-8 hours (`4h` to `8h`)
- **Integration Work**: 2-5 days (`2d` to `5d`)

#### **Example Estimates by Enhancement Type:**

**Option 1 (Learner Progress Tracking)**: `/estimate 2d` 
*Reasoning: Frontend UI + data persistence + cross-device compatibility*

**Option 2 (Trainer Poll Display)**: `/estimate 1d 4h`
*Reasoning: Real-time functionality + presentation integration*

**Option 3 (Content Preview)**: `/estimate 6h`
*Reasoning: Markdown processing + live preview implementation*

**Option 4 (Performance Improvement)**: `/estimate 1d 2h`
*Reasoning: Analysis + optimization + testing across scenarios*

#### **After Adding Estimate:**
- Notice the **Time tracking** sidebar now shows your estimate
- The issue list view will display time tracking columns
- Your estimate appears in the issue activity feed

### **Step 3: Practice Time Logging** (4 minutes)

#### **Simulate Development Work:**
Add time spent using the `/spend` quick action. Imagine you've worked on different aspects:

**Example Time Logging Scenario for Progress Tracking Feature:**

**Day 1 - Requirements Analysis:**
```
/spend 2h

Completed initial requirements analysis and user flow mapping for progress tracking feature. Reviewed existing navigation system and identified integration points.
```

**Day 2 - UI Design:**
```
/spend 3h

Designed progress bar component and dashboard layout. Created wireframes for mobile and desktop views. Confirmed accessibility requirements.
```

**Day 3 - Implementation Start:**
```
/spend 1h 30m

Set up component structure and initial progress calculation logic. Identified data storage approach using localStorage for prototype.
```

#### **Time Format Options:**
Practice different time formats in separate comments:
- **Minutes**: `30m`, `90m`
- **Hours**: `2h`, `4.5h`
- **Days**: `1d`, `0.5d`
- **Combinations**: `1d 2h 30m`, `2d 4h`

#### **Track Different Work Types:**
```
/spend 1h

Research phase: Investigated existing progress tracking solutions and GitLab's own progress indicators for UX inspiration.
```

```
/spend 2h 15m

Development: Implemented core progress calculation algorithm and integrated with existing slide navigation system.
```

### **Step 4: Create and Track a Second Issue** (5 minutes)

#### **Create a Related Issue:**
1. Create a **New Issue** for a smaller, related enhancement
2. Use this title format: `As a trainer, I want to reset learner progress data so that I can reuse training sessions with different groups`

#### **Quick Issue Content:**
```markdown
## üéØ User Story
As a trainer, I want to reset learner progress data for all participants so that I can reuse the same training session with different groups without showing previous learners' progress.

## üìã Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Reset button available on trainer dashboard
- [ ] Confirmation dialog prevents accidental resets
- [ ] Progress data is cleared for all learners
- [ ] Action is logged for audit purposes
- [ ] Feature works on both desktop and mobile

## üîß Technical Notes
This is a supporting feature for the progress tracking system. Should be straightforward data clearing operation.
```

#### **Practice Advanced Time Tracking:**
1. **Add estimate**: `/estimate 4h`
2. **Log time**: `/spend 1h` with comment about planning
3. **Update estimate**: `/estimate 6h` (realized it's more complex)
4. **Log more time**: `/spend 2h 30m` with development notes

### **Step 5: Explore Time Tracking Data** (3 minutes)

#### **Navigate to Issues List:**
1. Go to **Issues** ‚Üí **List**
2. Look for **Time tracking** column (may need to enable in column selector)
3. Notice **Estimate vs. Spent** data for your issues

#### **Review Issue Activity:**
1. Return to your main issue
2. Scroll through the **Activity** feed
3. Notice how time tracking appears in the timeline
4. See how estimates and time spent are clearly logged

#### **Check Sidebar Information:**
- **Time tracking** section shows total estimate vs. spent
- **Progress bar** indicates completion percentage
- **Time remaining** calculated automatically

### **Step 6: Advanced Time Management** (2 minutes)

#### **Practice Time Tracking Adjustments:**

**Remove an estimate (if needed):**
```
/remove_estimate
```

**Remove time spent (if logged incorrectly):**
```
/remove_time_spent
```

**Update with correct information:**
```
/estimate 1d 4h
/spend 45m

Corrected previous time entry. Actually spent less time due to reusing existing components from the navigation system.
```
