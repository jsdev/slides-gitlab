## ‚úÖ Definition of Done
- [ ] Feature functionality implemented and tested
- [ ] User interface is responsive and accessible
- [ ] Documentation updated (if applicable)
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing functionality

## üé® Additional Context
This feature would help trainers assess group progress and help learners stay motivated during longer training programs.
```

### **Step 3: Add Metadata and Organization** (2 minutes)

#### **Set Issue Metadata:**
- **Due Date**: Set a realistic deadline (2-4 weeks from now)
- **Assignee**: Assign to yourself for practice
- **Labels**: Add relevant labels (create new ones if needed):
  - `type::feature` (for new functionality)
  - `area::frontend` or `area::backend` (depending on your enhancement)
  - `priority::medium` (unless urgent)
  - `component::ui` (if interface changes)
  - `learner-experience`, `trainer-tools`, `content-creation`, or `performance` (based on your option)

#### **Story Points/Weight:**
- Add weight estimation: 1-2 (small), 3-5 (medium), 6-8 (large)
- Consider complexity, unknowns, and testing requirements

### **Step 4: Review and Refine** (1 minute)
- Check markdown formatting with preview
- Ensure acceptance criteria are specific and testable
- Verify all metadata is set appropriately

## üèÜ **Bonus Challenges**

### **Challenge 1: Create an Issue Template**
1. Navigate to **Settings** ‚Üí **Repository** ‚Üí **Issue Templates**
2. Create a template called "Feature Request" using your structure
3. Test the template by creating a second issue

### **Challenge 2: Practice Issue Relationships**
1. Create a second, smaller issue related to your first
2. Establish a blocking relationship: smaller issue blocks the larger one
3. Use issue references (#issue-number) to link them

### **Challenge 3: Advanced Markdown Practice**
Enhance your issue description with:
- **Bold** and *italic* text for emphasis
- [Links to external resources](https://docs.gitlab.com)
- Code blocks for technical details:
  ```javascript
  // Example code snippet
  ```
- Tables for structured information:
  | Feature | Priority | Effort |
  |---------|----------|--------|
  | Progress Bar | High | Medium |

## ü§î **Quality Check Questions**

### **User Story Validation:**
- **Is your user clearly defined?** (specific role, not just "user")
- **Is the action specific and actionable?** (concrete behavior, not vague)
- **Is the benefit clear and measurable?** (business value, not feature description)

### **Acceptance Criteria Review:**
- **Are criteria testable?** (can someone verify completion?)
- **Are they specific enough?** (no ambiguous language)
- **Do they cover the complete user flow?** (from start to finish)
- **Are edge cases considered?** (error states, different devices)

### **Technical Completeness:**
- **Are implementation considerations noted?** (constraints, dependencies)
- **Is the scope appropriate?** (not too big, not too small)
- **Are related systems identified?** (what else might be affected)
