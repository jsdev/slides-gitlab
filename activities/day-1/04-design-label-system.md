---

## ‚è±Ô∏è **Duration**: 15 minutes
- **Individual Design**: 8 minutes
- **Implementation & Testing**: 5 minutes
- **Reflection & Documentation**: 2 minutes

---

## üìã **Prerequisites**
- Completed Activity 1.2 (Create Your First Advanced Issue) and Activity 1.3 (Time Tracking Practice)
- At least one issue created in the slides-gitlab repository
- Access to create and manage labels in the repository
- Understanding of issue metadata from previous activities

---

## üöÄ **Your Mission**

You'll design and implement a comprehensive label system specifically for training platform development, applying your learning from previous activities to create an organizational structure that supports effective project management and team collaboration.

### **Training Platform Context**
The slides-gitlab platform serves trainers, learners, content creators, and platform administrators. Your label system should help organize development work across these different user groups and feature types while supporting the development workflow from idea to implementation.

## üìù **Step-by-Step Instructions**

### **Step 1: Analyze Your Existing Issues** (2 minutes)

#### **Review Your Previous Work:**
1. Navigate to **Issues** ‚Üí **List**
2. Look at the issues you created in Activities 1.2 and 1.3
3. Consider what information would help categorize and prioritize them

#### **Ask These Key Questions:**
- **What user type does each issue serve?** (learner, trainer, content creator, admin)
- **What part of the platform does it affect?** (UI, backend, content, performance)
- **How complex is the work involved?** (quick fix, medium feature, major enhancement)
- **What's the urgency level?** (critical bug, nice-to-have improvement)

### **Step 2: Design Your Scoped Label Categories** (3 minutes)

#### **Choose 3-4 Label Scopes for Training Platform Work:**

**Essential Scopes for Training Platforms:**

#### **Scope 1: User Experience (`ux::`)**
```
ux::learner     - Features for training participants
ux::trainer     - Tools for training delivery
ux::creator     - Content development features  
ux::admin       - Platform administration
```

#### **Scope 2: Component (`component::`)**
```
component::ui           - User interface changes
component::content      - Training content system
component::navigation   - Site navigation and routing
component::performance - Speed and optimization
component::integration - External tool connections
```

#### **Scope 3: Effort (`effort::`)**
```
effort::small   - 1-4 hours (quick fixes, minor UI)
effort::medium  - 1-2 days (new features, enhancements)
effort::large   - 3-5 days (major features, integrations)
effort::xl      - 1+ weeks (platform overhauls)
```

#### **Scope 4: Priority (`priority::`)**
```
priority::critical - Blocking training delivery
priority::high     - Improves training effectiveness
priority::medium   - Nice-to-have enhancement
priority::low      - Future consideration
```

### **Step 3: Choose Strategic Colors** (1 minute)

#### **Color Psychology for Training Platform Labels:**

**User Experience Colors:**
- `ux::learner` ‚Üí **Blue** (#007FFF) - Trust, learning, calm
- `ux::trainer` ‚Üí **Green** (#28A745) - Success, guidance, growth
- `ux::creator` ‚Üí **Purple** (#6F42C1) - Creativity, innovation
- `ux::admin` ‚Üí **Orange** (#FD7E14) - Management, control

**Component Colors:**
- `component::ui` ‚Üí **Light Blue** (#17A2B8) - Interface focus
- `component::content` ‚Üí **Teal** (#20C997) - Content creation
- `component::navigation` ‚Üí **Indigo** (#6610F2) - Structure
- `component::performance` ‚Üí **Red** (#DC3545) - Speed/urgency
- `component::integration` ‚Üí **Yellow** (#FFC107) - Connections

**Effort Colors (Size Progression):**
- `effort::small` ‚Üí **Light Green** (#90EE90) - Quick wins
- `effort::medium` ‚Üí **Yellow** (#FFD700) - Moderate work
- `effort::large` ‚Üí **Orange** (#FFA500) - Significant effort
- `effort::xl` ‚Üí **Red** (#FF6B6B) - Major undertaking

**Priority Colors (Urgency Scale):**
- `priority::critical` ‚Üí **Dark Red** (#B91C1C) - Immediate action
- `priority::high` ‚Üí **Orange** (#EA580C) - Important work
- `priority::medium` ‚Üí **Blue** (#2563EB) - Standard priority
- `priority::low` ‚Üí **Gray** (#6B7280) - Future consideration

### **Step 4: Implement Your Label System** (3 minutes)

#### **Create Labels in GitLab:**
1. Navigate to **Issues** ‚Üí **Labels**
2. Click **New Label** for each label you want to create
3. Use the naming convention: `scope::value`
4. Apply your chosen colors
5. Add descriptions for clarity

#### **Essential Labels to Create First:**

**Start with these high-impact labels:**
```
ux::learner         - For training participant experience features
ux::trainer         - For training delivery and presentation tools
component::ui       - For user interface and design changes
effort::small       - For quick wins and minor improvements
priority::high      - For important training effectiveness improvements
```

#### **Label Creation Template:**
```
Name: ux::learner
Description: Features and improvements for training participants
Color: #007FFF (Blue)
```

### **Step 5: Apply Labels to Your Existing Issues** (2 minutes)

#### **Label Your Previous Issues:**
1. Open the advanced issue you created in Activity 1.2
2. Click **Edit** and add appropriate labels:
   - Choose the user experience type (`ux::learner`, `ux::trainer`, etc.)
   - Select the component affected (`component::ui`, `component::content`)
   - Estimate the effort level (`effort::medium` for most new features)
   - Set the priority based on training impact

#### **Example Labeling for Progress Tracking Feature:**
```
Labels to Add:
- ux::learner (benefits training participants)
- component::ui (requires interface changes)  
- effort::medium (estimated 1-2 days of work)
- priority::high (significantly improves training experience)
```

### **Step 6: Test Your Label System** (2 minutes)

#### **Practice Label Filtering:**
1. Go to **Issues** ‚Üí **List**
2. Use the **Label** filter to test your system:
   - Filter by `ux::learner` to see all learner-focused features
   - Filter by `effort::small` to find quick wins for sprint planning
   - Combine filters: `ux::trainer` + `priority::high` for urgent trainer tools

#### **Validate Your System:**
- **Can you quickly find all UI-related work?** (filter by `component::ui`)
- **Can you identify quick wins for a sprint?** (filter by `effort::small`)
- **Can you prioritize trainer needs?** (filter by `ux::trainer` + `priority::high`)

## üèÜ **Bonus Challenges**

### **Challenge 1: Create a Status Workflow Scope**
Add a `status::` scope to track issue progression:
```
status::backlog    - Ideas and planned work
status::ready      - Defined and ready for development  
status::progress   - Currently being worked on
status::review     - Awaiting code or design review
status::testing    - In QA or user testing phase
status::done       - Completed and deployed
```

### **Challenge 2: Design Team Assignment Labels**
Create labels for different development skills:
```
team::frontend     - UI/UX development work
team::backend      - Server and database work
team::content      - Training material creation
team::design       - Visual and interaction design
team::qa           - Testing and quality assurance
```

### **Challenge 3: Advanced Label Automation**
Research GitLab's label automation features:
- **Auto-labeling**: Rules that apply labels based on issue content
- **Label templates**: Predefined label sets for different project types
- **Issue boards**: Using labels to create workflow boards

## ü§î **Design Validation Questions**

### **System Usability:**
- **Can you find relevant issues in under 30 seconds?** (filtering effectiveness)
- **Do your labels answer the most common questions?** (who, what, when, why)
- **Is the system simple enough for new team members?** (cognitive load)

### **Training Platform Relevance:**
- **Do your labels reflect actual training platform needs?** (user types, components)
- **Can trainers and content creators understand the labels?** (stakeholder clarity)
- **Do the labels support sprint planning decisions?** (effort, priority)

### **Scalability Considerations:**
- **Will this system work with 50+ issues?** (organizational capacity)
- **Can you add new labels without breaking the system?** (extensibility)
- **Do the labels reduce decision fatigue?** (clarity of choices)
