# Activity 2.5: Building and Communicating with Roadmaps

## üéØ **Objective**
Master GitLab's roadmap visualization to communicate strategic plans effectively, using the slides-gitlab repository to create roadmaps for training content development, platform enhancement, and educational delivery initiatives.

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è **Duration**: 20 minutes
- **Individual Practice**: 15 minutes
- **Review & Discussion**: 5 minutes

---

## üìã **Prerequisites**
- Access to the `slides-gitlab` GitLab repository with Maintainer permissions
- Completed Activities 2.1-2.4 (Milestone and Epic management)
- Understanding of GitLab epics and milestones
- Existing epics in the repository (or ability to create them)

---

## üöÄ **Your Mission**

You'll build a strategic roadmap that tells the story of slides-gitlab platform evolution, showing how training content development, technical enhancements, and educational delivery initiatives align over time.

### **Repository Context**
The slides-gitlab platform serves multiple stakeholders with different timelines: content creators need regular material updates, developers require platform improvements, and trainers need feature rollouts aligned with training schedules. Your roadmap will visualize how these initiatives coordinate.

---

## üìù **Step-by-Step Instructions**

### **Step 1: Navigate to Roadmap View** (2 minutes)
1. Go to your `slides-gitlab` repository
2. Navigate to **Issues** ‚Üí **Epics** ‚Üí **Roadmap**
3. Familiarize yourself with the current view and timeline options

### **Step 2: Identify or Create Core Epics** (5 minutes)

**Find or Create These Training Platform Epics:**

#### **Epic 1: Content Development Pipeline** 
- **Title**: "Enhanced Training Content Creation Workflow"
- **Description**: Streamline slide creation, exercise development, and content review processes
- **Timeline**: Start date: First of this month, Duration: 2 months
- **Priority**: High (affects all training delivery)

#### **Epic 2: Interactive Learning Platform**
- **Title**: "Advanced Interactive Exercise Platform" 
- **Description**: Expand simulator capabilities, assessment tools, and learner progress tracking
- **Timeline**: Start date: 3 weeks from now, Duration: 3 months
- **Priority**: Medium (enhances learning experience)

#### **Epic 3: Training Delivery Infrastructure**
- **Title**: "Scalable Training Environment Management"
- **Description**: Automated GitLab instance provisioning, trainer tools, and session management
- **Timeline**: Start date: 6 weeks from now, Duration: 4 months  
- **Priority**: High (enables training scalability)

### **Step 3: Practice Timeline Adjustments** (5 minutes)

**Scenario-Based Timeline Management:**

#### **Adjustment 1: Priority Shift**
- **Situation**: "Leadership wants the Interactive Learning Platform delivered before Q3"
- **Task**: Drag the Interactive Learning Platform epic to start 2 weeks earlier
- **Observe**: How does this affect resource allocation visualization?

#### **Adjustment 2: Scope Extension**
- **Situation**: "Content Development Pipeline needs additional review cycles"
- **Task**: Extend the Content Development Pipeline epic duration by 3 weeks
- **Observe**: How does this impact downstream dependencies?

#### **Adjustment 3: Resource Reallocation**
- **Situation**: "Training Infrastructure epic can start earlier due to available developers"
- **Task**: Move Training Infrastructure epic start date 2 weeks earlier
- **Observe**: What overlaps become visible on the roadmap?

### **Step 4: Explore Different Views** (2 minutes)
1. **Switch to Months view**: Analyze detailed quarterly planning
2. **Switch to Quarters view**: Focus on high-level strategic alignment
3. **Toggle between views**: Notice how different stakeholders need different perspectives

### **Step 5: Roadmap Storytelling** (1 minute)
Create a narrative around your roadmap that answers:
- What strategic priorities does this timeline communicate?
- How do content, platform, and infrastructure initiatives coordinate?
- Where are the critical dependencies and potential bottlenecks?

---

## ü§î **Guiding Questions**

### **Strategic Communication Questions:**
- **What story does this roadmap tell about slides-gitlab priorities for the next quarter?**
  - Content development pace and delivery schedule
  - Technical platform evolution and capability growth
  - Training infrastructure scaling and operational readiness

- **If a stakeholder asked to accelerate the Interactive Learning Platform by one month, what visual impact would that create?**
  - Resource conflicts with Content Development Pipeline
  - Dependencies on Training Infrastructure readiness
  - Impact on quality gates and testing phases

- **How could this view help during quarterly planning meetings?**
  - Visual alignment of cross-functional initiatives
  - Clear communication of trade-offs and dependencies
  - Stakeholder alignment on realistic timelines

### **Practical Application Questions:**
- **Which epics show the most flexibility for timeline adjustments?**
- **Where do you see potential resource conflicts between initiatives?**
- **How would you communicate delays or scope changes using this view?**

### **Stakeholder Perspective Questions:**
- **Content Team View**: "When will new content creation tools be available?"
- **Development Team View**: "How do platform improvements align with content needs?"
- **Training Team View**: "When can we promise new capabilities to clients?"

---

## üèÜ **Advanced Challenges**

### **Challenge 1: Multi-Stakeholder Roadmaps**
Create different roadmap views for different audiences:
- **Executive View**: High-level quarterly milestones only
- **Content Team View**: Detailed content development timeline
- **Technical Team View**: Platform enhancement and infrastructure focus

### **Challenge 2: Dependency Visualization**
Use roadmap features to show:
- **Blocking Dependencies**: What must complete before other work can start
- **Resource Dependencies**: Where the same team works on multiple epics
- **External Dependencies**: How client feedback cycles affect timeline

### **Challenge 3: Risk Communication**
Enhance your roadmap to communicate:
- **Buffer Time**: Built-in flexibility for scope changes
- **Critical Path**: Which delays would affect delivery dates
- **Contingency Plans**: Alternative sequencing if priorities shift
