- **Story Points**: 3
- **Assignee**: QA/Reviewer

**Total**: 21 story points (adjust to fit your calculated capacity)

### **Step 2: Assign Issues to Milestone** (1 minute)
For each issue you create:
1. Go to the issue page
2. Click **"Edit"**
3. Select your `Sprint 13 - Platform Basics` milestone
4. Save the issue

### **Step 3: Complete Milestone Description** (1 minute)
Add the final sections to your milestone description:

```markdown
## üéØ Definition of Done
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by at least 1 team member
- [ ] Content reviewed for accuracy and clarity
- [ ] Basic testing completed (manual or automated)
- [ ] Documentation updated where applicable
- [ ] Accessibility guidelines followed
- [ ] No critical bugs introduced

## üìä Sprint Backlog
**Committed Stories**: 21 story points
**Team Capacity**: 80 story points
**Capacity Utilization**: 26% (conservative for learning sprint)

### Issue Breakdown:
- Content Enhancement: 8 pts
- Interactive Exercise: 5 pts
- Bug Fix: 3 pts
- Documentation: 2 pts
- Testing: 3 pts

## üéØ **Story Point Allocation Strategies**

### **Strategy 1: Conservative Loading (Recommended for Learning)**
- Use 25-50% of total capacity
- Focus on completing fewer items well
- Build confidence and team rhythm

### **Strategy 2: Balanced Loading**
- Use 60-80% of total capacity
- Mix of different story point sizes
- Realistic for experienced teams

### **Strategy 3: Aggressive Loading**
- Use 80-95% of total capacity
- Only for very experienced, stable teams
- High risk of not completing sprint goal

### **Story Point Distribution Guidelines:**
- **Small (1-3 pts)**: 40-50% of stories
- **Medium (5-8 pts)**: 30-40% of stories  
- **Large (13+ pts)**: 10-20% of stories (break down if possible)

## üèÜ **Advanced Sprint Management**

### **Issue Prioritization Framework:**
1. **Critical Bugs**: Must fix, affects users
2. **High-Value Features**: Direct business impact
3. **Technical Debt**: Impacts team velocity
4. **Nice-to-Have**: Only if capacity allows

### **Risk Management:**
- **Dependency Issues**: Mark issues with external dependencies
- **Knowledge Gaps**: Identify items requiring learning
- **Resource Constraints**: Note any special tool/access needs
- **Time Boxing**: Set maximum time limits for research tasks

### **Sprint Commitment Guidelines:**
- **Must-Have**: Core sprint goal items (60-70% of capacity)
- **Should-Have**: Important but not critical (20-30% of capacity)
- **Could-Have**: Stretch goals if time permits (5-10% of capacity)

---

## ü§î **Sprint Validation Questions**

### **Capacity Check:**
- Does total story points ‚â§ team capacity?
- Is there a mix of story point sizes?
- Are all team members appropriately loaded?
- Is there buffer for unexpected work?

### **Quality Check:**
- Is the Definition of Done realistic and clear?
- Are all issues properly labeled and assigned?
- Do issues contribute to the sprint goal?
- Are dependencies identified and managed?

### **Team Readiness:**
- Does everyone understand their assignments?
- Are there any blocking dependencies?
- Do we have all necessary tools and access?
- Is the sprint goal achievable and valuable?
